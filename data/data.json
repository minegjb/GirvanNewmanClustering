    "abstract": "For road transportation, adaptive cruise control (ACC) is a widely used driver assistance technique with partially longitudinal automation. The existing ACC systems usually ignore the road elevation information, which often ends up with large tracking error and poor fuel economy on the roads with up and down slopes. This paper presents a model-based predictive controller (MPC) for fuel-saving ACC to improve the performances on tracking accuracy and fuel consumption by simultaneously considering the road elevation information, nonlinear powertrain dynamics, and spatiotemporal constraint from preceding vehicle. The feasibility of MPC is enhanced by softening nonsafety related hard constraints, and its asymptotical stability is proved by considering the monotonicity property of a properly chosen Lyapunov function. To efficiently compute the optimal control sequence, a pseudospectral discretization technique, instead of evenly spaced discretization, is adopted to transform the continuous-time optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method could reduce fuel consumption by 2.65% in a typical driving scenario and significantly improve the tracking accuracy compared to the one without road slope consideration.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2017.2708599",
    "publication_date": "March 2017",
    "abstract": "In the past several decades, various types of technologies have been developed to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and reduce tailpipe emissions across different dimensions. For example, powertrain-related technologies improve fuel efficiency by optimizing the powertrain operations in response to different driving conditions (e.g., energy management system for plugin hybrid electric vehicles); another technology dimension lies in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which improve vehicle fuel efficiency by optimizing the vehicle dynamics or speed under different traffic conditions (e.g., eco-speed harmonization and eco-approach and departure). However, very little effort has been made to investigate the combined benefit of integrating both powertrain and ITS technology dimensions together. In this paper, an integrated and connected eco-driving assistance system with co-optimization of vehicle dynamics and powertrain operations for PHEVs is proposed. To fully evaluate the performance of the proposed system at different vehicle automation levels, real-world driving data for different eco-driving technological stages were collected: uninformed manual driving, eco-driving with an in-vehicle advisory display, and an eco-driving system with automatic longitudinal control. The numerical analysis shows that the co-optimization is able to achieve on average 24% fuel savings for typical urban driving conditions.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2018",
    "abstract": "A novel method for integrating driving behavior and traffic context through signal symbolization is presented in this paper. This symbolization framework is proposed as a data reduction method for naturalistic driving studies. Continuous sensor signals have been converted and reduced into sequences of symbols (chunks) using a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model and a nested Pitman-Yor language model. Then, co-occurrence chunking (COOC), the proposed integration method, has been applied to the driver behavior and the traffic context chunks. After the integration, COOC chunks have been associated with prototype driving scenes by using latent Dirichlet allocation. Finally, the translated sequence of chunks has been clustered into groups. Risky lane change detection experiments have been conducted with the symbolized data for evaluation purposes. A dataset comprised of 988 lane change scenes has been utilized for this process. Co-occurrence chunking with clustering provided the best risky lane change detection.",

The three dimensionality of the road is recognized by the optimal control calculations. Fuel efficiency is achieved by optimally exploiting the primary and secondary energy sources and controlling the vehicle so that the fuel consumption is minimized for a given but arbitrary three-dimensional route. A time-of-arrival constraint rather than a driving cycle is used. The benefits of using multiple auxiliary storage systems are demonstrated and a lower-bound estimate of the fuel consumption is presented.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2017.2788208",
    "publication_date": "March 2018",
    "abstract": "Automated driving requires decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments. The uncertainty from the prediction originates from the noisy sensor data and from the fact that the intention of human drivers cannot be directly measured. This problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with the intended route of the other vehicles as hidden variables. The solution of the POMDP is a policy determining the optimal acceleration of the ego vehicle along a preplanned path. Therefore, the policy is optimized for the most likely future scenarios resulting from an interactive, probabilistic motion model for the other vehicles. Considering possible future measurements of the surrounding cars allows the autonomous car to incorporate the estimated change in future prediction accuracy in the optimal policy. A compact representation results in a low-dimensional state-space. Thus, the problem can be solved online for varying road layouts and number of vehicles. This is done with a point-based solver in an anytime fashion on a continuous state-space. Our evaluation is threefold: At first, the convergence of the algorithm is evaluated and it is shown how the convergence can be improved with an additional search heuristic. Second, we show various planning scenarios to demonstrate how the introduction of different considered uncertainties results in more conservative planning. At the end, we show online simulations for the crossing of complex (unsignalized) intersections. We can demonstrate that our approach performs nearly as good as with full prior information about the intentions of the other vehicles and clearly outperforms reactive approaches.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2017.2708600",
    "publication_date": "March 2017",
    "abstract": "In order to formulate a high-level understanding of driver behavior from massive naturalistic driving data, an effective approach is needed to automatically process or segregate data into low-level maneuvers. Besides traditional computer vision processing, this study addresses the lane-change detection problem by using vehicle dynamic signals (steering angle and vehicle speed) extracted from the CAN-bus, which is collected with 58 drivers around Dallas, TX area. After reviewing the literature, this study proposes a machine learning-based segmentation and classification algorithm, which is stratified into three stages. The first stage is preprocessing and prefiltering, which is intended to reduce noise and remove clear left and right turning events. Second, a spectral time-frequency analysis segmentation approach is employed to generalize all potential time-variant lane-change and lane-keeping candidates. The final stage compares two possible classification methods-1) dynamic time warping feature with k -nearest neighbor classifier and 2) hidden state sequence prediction with a combined hidden Markov model. The overall optimal classification accuracy can be obtained at 80.36% for lane-change-left and 83.22% for lane-change-right. The effectiveness and issues of failures are also discussed. With the availability of future large-scale naturalistic driving data, such as SHRP2, this proposed effective lane-change detection approach can further contribute to characterize both automatic route recognition as well as distracted driving state analysis.",

    "abstract": "During assisted and partially automated driving, having awareness of the automation system's functionality is essential for drivers to fulfill their supervising task adequately. Feedback on state transitions and intentions of the automation system is necessary to obtain, as well as increase the driver's awareness of the automation. In this contribution, feedback for drivers is communicated via active vehicle pitch motions, and not visually, as is usually the case. Comprehensibility and perceptibility are important criteria regarding the effectiveness of feedback. To evaluate these two criteria, a driving study (N = 36) is conducted in real traffic on a motorway in which vehicle guidance is performed by an automation system. The results reveal that 89% of the participants perceive active pitch motions and do not regard them as passive pitch motions induced by the vehicle's acceleration or deceleration. Following, these nonexpert participants were expected to determine the meaning of these pitch motions and report using the think-aloud method. A total of 84% of the participants who were given the chance to understand the meaning of these motions were able to do so. Active vehicle motions, therefore, present a feedback approach that is independent of the driver's viewing direction. These can complement visual feedback, thus resulting in multimodal feedback.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2020",
    "abstract": "In the context of autonomous driving, where humans may need to take over in the event where the computer may issue a takeover request, a key step towards driving safety is the monitoring of the hands to ensure the driver is ready for such a request. This work, focuses on the first step of this process, which is to locate the hands. Such a system must work in real-time and under varying harsh lighting conditions. This article introduces a fast ConvNet approach, based on the work of original work of OpenPose by Cao, et al. for full body joint estimation. The network is modified with fewer parameters and retrained using our own day-time naturalistic autonomous driving dataset to estimate joint and affinity heatmaps for driver and passenger's wrist and elbows, for a total of 8 joint classes and part affinity fields between each wrist-elbow pair. The approach runs real-time on real-world data at 40 fps on multiple drivers and passengers. The system is extensively evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing at least 95% detection performance on joint localization and arm-angle estimation.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2017",
    "abstract": "The rapid development of road networks in highly urbanized cities requires a substantial number of viaducts to reduce the increasing traffic burden on urban highways. Unfortunately, this road design deteriorates the performance of global positioning system (GPS) navigators due to the signal blockage between satellite and receiver. As a result, it is difficult for GPS navigators to determine whether the vehicle is driving on the street or viaduct. Misleading information could confuse drivers and lead them to drive irregularly, which is dangerous in heavy traffic. This paper proposes a novel classification algorithm based on the fact that different satellite signals and conditions can be observed in the on-street and on-viaduct cases by the implementation of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to distinguish the driving area of a vehicle. In addition, the proposed DBN can also accurately estimate the driving altitude of the vehicle according to the experiment results.",

    "abstract": "Driver gaze has been shown to be an excellent surrogate for driver attention in intelligent vehicles. With the recent surge of highly autonomous vehicles, driver gaze can be useful for determining the handoff time to a human driver. While there has been significant improvement in personalized driver gaze zone estimation systems, a generalized system which is invariant to different subjects, perspectives, and scales is still lacking. We take a step toward this generalized system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We finetune four popular CNN architectures for this task, and provide extensive comparisons of their outputs. We additionally experiment with different input image patches, and also examine how the image size affects performance. For training and testing the networks, we collect a large naturalistic driving dataset comprising of 11 long drives, driven by ten subjects in two different cars. Our best performing model achieves an accuracy of 95.18% during cross-subject testing, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques for this task. Finally, we evaluate our best performing model on the publicly available Columbia gaze dataset comprising of images from 56 subjects with varying head pose and gaze directions. Without any training, our model successfully encodes the different gaze directions on this diverse dataset, demonstrating good generalization capabilities.",

    "publication_date": "March 2020",
    "abstract": "In this article we present a trajectory generation method for autonomous overtaking of unexpected obstacles in a dynamic urban environment. In these settings, blind spots can arise from perception limitations. For example when overtaking unexpected objects on the vehicle's ego lane on a two-way street. In this case, a human driver would first make sure that the opposite lane is free and that there is enough room to successfully execute the maneuver, and then it would cut into the opposite lane in order to execute the maneuver successfully. We consider the practical problem of autonomous overtaking when the coverage of the perception system is impaired due to occlusion. Safe trajectories are generated by solving, in real-time, a non-linear constrained optimization, formulated as a receding horizon planner that maximizes the ego vehicle's visibility. The planner is complemented by a high-level behavior planner, which takes into account the occupancy of other traffic participants, the information from the vehicle's perception system, and the risk associated with the overtaking maneuver, to determine when the overtake maneuver should happen. The approach is validated in simulation and in experiments in real world traffic.",

Seven key variables are identified and analyzed, and their possible values are used to describe the most representative road departure test scenarios on both straight roads and curved roads. The overall structure and components of data collection and postprocessing systems for RDPSs' evaluation are devised and presented. The algorithms for computing vehicle dynamic information are developed. Experiments are performed on the test track under various scenarios. The results show that the sensing system and data postprocessing system can capture all necessary signals accurately and display the test vehicle motion profile effectively.",

    "publication_date": "March 2018",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel communication-enabled distributed conflict resolution mechanism in order for a group of connected autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in intersections without any traffic manager. The conflict resolution strategy for individual vehicle is decoupled temporally. In a decision maker, the vehicle computes the desired time slots to pass the conflict zones by solving a conflict graph locally based on the broadcasted information from other vehicles. In a motion planner, the vehicle computes the desired speed profile by solving a temporal optimization problem constrained in the desired time slot. The estimated time to occupy the conflict zones given the new speed profile is then broadcasted again. It is proved that the aggregation of these local decisions solves the conflicts globally. Theoretically, this method provides an efficient parallel mechanism to obtain local optimal solutions of a large-scale optimization problem (e.g., multivehicle navigation). Application-wise, as demonstrated by extensive simulation, this mechanism increases the efficiency of autonomous vehicles in terms of smaller delay time, as well as the efficiency of the traffic in terms of larger throughput when there is no traffic manager to mediate the conflicts.",

    "abstract": "High-precision localization has drawn more and more attention in recent research of intelligent vehicle systems and autonomous robot navigation technology. In most methods, the approaches are only effective in some specific situations. In other words, these methods can only perform well with obvious features, like tall building walls, road curbs, etc. In this paper, a novel framework for precise localization of autonomous vehicle applying to different scenes especially some typical urban environments is proposed. The main procedures of this method include mapping and localization. During mapping process, inertial measurement unit, odometry, and high-precision GPS are fused together with the data sensed by LIDAR, a high-precision map that could provide global position and pose is generated using rolling window. When localizing, live laser data align with the prior-map. A particle filter based point cloud matching method is utilized here. Based on this, a hierarchical localizing method is proposed, which is more accurate and faster than the original matching method. With this method, the sampling guided by proposal density is propagated upward every hierarchy. Besides that, some accelerating algorithms are utilized to make this approach real time. Finally, decimeter-level localization is achieved in different environments, which is proven by some experiments.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an energy optimal controller is designed with torque, speed and battery constraints, and detailed sensitivity analyses are performed. The design is tested on the gross motion mathematical model of the vehicle moving on a variable-slope road in scenarios including uphill and downhill road sections of various slopes and lengths. The tests are repeated along roads with icy slopes, and the superiority of the energy optimal controller is verified for roads with low friction coefficients. A skidding compensation logic is proposed, and it is observed that the energy optimal solution is insensitive to such compensation methods. Further sensitivity analyses are performed, and it is shown that as a representative of different passenger seating arrangements, the sensitivity of the energy optimal controller to the changes in mass and its distribution is small in magnitude. The tests with different initial state-of-charge of the battery demonstrate that the superiority of the energy optimal controller becomes significant especially when battery characteristics limit the charging capability during regenerative braking.",

    "abstract": "An open-source vehicle automation methodology, and platform for road vehicles (cars, and trucks) is presented. The platform hardware, and software, based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), are detailed. Two strategies are discussed for enabling the remote control of a vehicle (in this case, an electric 2013 Ford Focus). The first approach used digital filtering of Controller Area Network (CAN) messages. In the case of the test vehicle, this approach allowed for the control of acceleration from a tap-point on the CAN bus, and the OBD-II port. The second approach, based on the emulation of the analog output(s) of a vehicle's accelerator pedal, brake pedal, and steering torque sensors, is more generally applicable and, in the test vehicle, allowed for the full control vehicle acceleration, braking, and steering. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, and platform for vehicle automation research, a very basic low-level velocity, and steering controllers are developed. Additionally a high level path following algorithm was developed. Finally, the system is validated experimentally.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2018.2886689",
    "publication_date": "March 2019",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an illumination-invariant nonparametric model for urban road detection based on a monocular camera and a single-line LIDAR sensor. With the monocular camera, we propose a new shadow removal method to obtain an illumination-invariant image representation. Consequently, we can accurately locate the road vanishing point after removing the adverse shadowy effect. With the constraint of the detected vanishing point, we propose a Dijkstra-based method to compute a minimum-cost map, where the minimum-cost path from the vanishing point to any other pixel can be found. With the single line LIDAR sensor, we can locate a few potential curb points in the image bottom region, and thus we can obtain several corresponding minimum-cost paths that originate from the vanishing point to the curb points. Thereafter, two most likely road borders can be found from these paths, respectively. Our learning-free method has been tested on over 4000 images of the KITTI-Odometry Dataset [A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R.Urtasun, “Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite,” in Proc. IEEE Conf. Comput. Vision Pattern Recognit., 2012, pp. 3354-3361.] and the Oxford Robotcar Dataset [W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman, “1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford robotcar dataset,” Int. J. Robot. Res., vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 3-15, 2017.]. It works accurately on a variety of road scenes and is competitive compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods that need extensive training data.",

In search of an optimal solution for the designed robust controller, a H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</sub>\n disturbance attenuation performance together with the weighted H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n norm for minimizing the mean disturbance rejection, are considered using the Chaos-enhanced Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (CAPSO). The optimization problem for the proposed controller is formulated to minimize the frequency-weighted vibration dose value (VDV) due to acceleration response at the seat, while constraining the relative displacement between the seat and the seat base. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated through comparisons with performance achieved through some of the reported other seat suspension robust controllers in addition to a passive suspension. Results show that the proposed optimal robust controller could provide substantial reductions in the frequency-weighted acceleration at the seat and the VDV, measures of the force applied to the driver due to terrain induced vibration and shock, while limiting the relative displacement between the seat and the seat base.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2017",
    "abstract": "Self-driving systems are expected to become increasingly popular in the foreseeable future. However, a driver who is out of the control loop might reduce overall situation awareness by overly trusting automated driving systems. Alternatively, the introduction of automated driving systems could lead to misuse or disuse. For these reasons, an automated driving system should encourage appropriate driver reliance to achieve social acceptance. Imperfect information of the system sensing range might adversely affect trust. This study used a vibrotactile display with an automated driving system to provide situation awareness. The display contributes to driver trust by enabling a driver to predict or perceive actions selected by the system. The display provides spatial information related to traffic objects by haptic stimulus. The driving scenario of passing a motorbike with vehicles approaching from behind was considered. The results of this driving simulator study demonstrated that the spatial information and the behavior of the system affected trust.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we take advantage of the communication systems which will be adopted for the new vehicle generations in near future and we propose a new electric vehicle (EV) charge/discharge service scheme for large EV density through vehicular ad-hoc networks communications. First, we present a communication protocol for the EV charging/discharging protocol with the uplink and the downlink EV charge /discharge frame format exchanged between EVs and smart grid. Second, we propose our channel access scheme based on a distributed time slot assignment model (DTSA) to allow the EV charging/discharging service negotiations with smart grid before plug-in phase. This DTSA scheme, which is a contention-free channel access mechanism, can improve the EV charging/discharging service access by increasing the successful rate of channel reservation both on control channel (CCH) and service channel (SCH). We propose also three algorithms to manage the EV charge/discharge service reservation and negotiation, respectively, on CCH and SCH. Finally, extensive simulations with NS-2 and MATLAB are conducted to validate the proposed approach and demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed compared to IEEE802.11p and VeMAC while satisfying the defined constraints.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-vehicle communication has a great potential to improve reaction accuracy of different driver assistance systems in critical driving situations. Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), which is an automated application, provides drivers with extra benefits such as traffic throughput maximization and collision avoidance. CACC systems must be designed in a way that are sufficiently robust against all special maneuvers, such as cutting-into the CACC platoons by interfering vehicles or hard braking by leading cars. To address this problem, a neural-network-based cut-in detection and trajectory prediction scheme is proposed in the first part of this paper. Next, a probabilistic framework is developed in which the cut-in probability is calculated based on the output of the mentioned cut-in prediction block. Finally, a specific stochastic model predictive controller is designed which incorporates this cut-in probability to enhance its reaction against the detected dangerous cut-in maneuver. The overall system is implemented, and its performance is evaluated using realistic driving scenarios from safety pilot model deployment.",

    "abstract": "In order to safely navigate highly dynamic scenarios, automated vehicles must be able to react quickly to changes in the environment and be able to understand trade-offs between lateral and longitudinal forces when limited by tire-road friction. We present a design and experimental validation of a nonlinear model predictive controller that is capable of handling these complex situations. By carefully selecting the vehicle model and mathematical encodings of the vehicle and obstacles, we enable the controller to quickly compute inputs while maintaining an accurate model of the vehicle's motion and its proximity to obstacles. Experimental results of a test vehicle performing an emergency double lane change to avoid two “pop-up” obstacles demonstrate the ability of the controller to coordinate lateral and longitudinal tire forces even in emergency situations when the tires are at their friction limits.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, fast and accurate trajectory tracking control of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with complex unknowns, including unmodeled dynamics, uncertainties, and/or unknown disturbances, is addressed within a proposed homogeneity-based finite-time control (HFC) framework. Major contributions are as follows: first, in the absence of external disturbances, a nominal HFC framework is established to achieve exact trajectory tracking control of an ASV, whereby global finite-time stability is ensured by combining homogeneous analysis and Lyapunov approach; second, within the HFC scheme, a finite-time disturbance observer (FDO) is further nested to rapidly and accurately reject complex disturbances, and thereby contributing to an FDO-based HFC (FDO-HFC) scheme, which can realize exactness of trajectory tracking and disturbance observation; and third, aiming to exactly deal with complicated unknowns including unmodeled dynamics and/or disturbances, a finite-time unknown observer (FUO) is deployed as a patch for the nominal HFC framework, and eventually results in an FUO-based HFC (FUO-HFC) scheme, which guarantees that accurate trajectory tracking can be achieved for an ASV under harsh environments. Simulation studies and comprehensive comparisons conducted on a benchmark ship demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HFC schemes.",

    "abstract": "Environment perception is a key enabling technology in autonomous vehicles, and multiple object tracking is an important part of this. The use of high resolution sensors, such as automotive radar and lidar, leads to the extended object tracking problem, with multiple detections per tracked object. For computationally feasible multiple extended object tracking, the data association problem must be handled. Previous work has relied on a two-step approach, using clustering algorithms, together with assignment algorithms, to achieve this. In this paper, we show that it is possible to handle the data association in a single step that works directly on the desired likelihood function. Single step data association is beneficial, because it enables better use of the measurement model and the predicted multiobject density. For single step data association, we use algorithms based on stochastic sampling, and integrate them into a Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture filter. In a simulation study, and in an experiment with Velodyne data acquired in an urban environment, four sampling algorithms are compared to clustering and assignment. The results from the simulations and the experiment show that single-step likelihood-based data association achieves better performance than two-step clustering and assignment data association does.",

This paper presents an experimental proof of concept, with a 1/5th scale car platform, of a maneuver selection scheme for low adhesion conditions.

    "publication_date": "March 2016",
    "abstract": "Humans assimilate information from the traffic environment mainly through visual perception. Obviously, the dominant information required to conduct a vehicle can be acquired with visual sensors. However, in contrast to most other sensor principles, video signals contain relevant information in a highly indirect manner and hence visual sensing requires sophisticated machine vision and image understanding techniques. This paper provides an overview on the state of research in the field of machine vision for intelligent vehicles. The functional spectrum addressed covers the range from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous driving. The organization of the article adopts the typical order in image processing pipelines that successively condense the rich information and vast amount of data in video sequences. Data-intensive low-level “early vision” techniques first extract features that are later grouped and further processed to obtain information of direct relevance for vehicle guidance. Recognition and classification schemes allow to identify specific objects in a traffic scene. Recently, semantic labeling techniques using convolutional neural networks have achieved impressive results in this field. High-level decisions of intelligent vehicles are often influenced by map data. The emerging role of machine vision in the mapping and localization process is illustrated at the example of autonomous driving. Scene representation methods are discussed that organize the information from all sensors and data sources and thus build the interface between perception and planning. Recently, vision benchmarks have been tailored to various tasks in traffic scene perception that provide a metric for the rich diversity of machine vision methods. Finally, the paper addresses computing architectures suited to real-time implementation. Throughout the paper, numerous specific examples and real world experiments with prototype vehicles are presented.",

    "abstract": "Lateral control of an autonomous and connected vehicle (ACV), especially in emergency situations, is important from the safety viewpoint. In these situations, the trajectory to be followed by an ACV must either be planned in real-time (e.g., for a possible evasion maneuver if the obstacle to be avoided is detected) or be communicated from its preceding vehicle. Typically, the trajectory information is available to the following ACV in the form of GPS time samples. From the viewpoint of lateral control, the lateral velocity information is not readily available and the feedback structure must reflect this reality. In this paper, we develop a methodology to synthesize a lateral control algorithm for a following ACV in a two-vehicle platoon in two steps: 1) From the limited preview information of the trajectory to be tracked via samples of GPS way points, we estimate the radius of curvature of the trajectory using “least-square” estimation and 2) develop a fixed-structure feedback control scheme for following the predecessor by synthesizing the set of stabilizing gains corresponding to lateral position error, heading error and heading rate error. Numerical simulation and experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.",

    "abstract": "In order to enable automated driving systems on the road, several key challenges need to be solved. One of these issues is real-time maneuver decision and trajectory planning. This paper introduces a general framework for maneuver and trajectory planning with model predictive methods. It discusses several representations of this framework in distinct complexity levels. In general, sophisticated models require to nonquadratic objective functions with nonlinear constraints, leading to increased computational complexities during calculation. Yet, oversimplified models can neither cope with vehicle dynamics in critical maneuvers nor do they represent complex traffic scenes with several maneuver options appropriately. A scheme to partition the trajectory space into homotopy regions is proposed. In each homotopy class, linearization about a trajectory from this class is applied. Demonstrations by simulation and with experimental vehicles show the capability of the proposed method in selecting optimal maneuvers and trajectories. This is even valid during extreme maneuvers, such as in last moment collision avoidance.",

    "abstract": "Distracted driving is among the primary causes for serious car accidents. Among the leading cause of death among teenagers today are traffic accidents and major part of them are related to distracted driving. We propose here an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network-based driver distraction recognition (DDR) system that can generalize to diverse driving conditions. The proposed method consists of two steps: developing generative models to produce images of different driving scenarios and developing a discriminative model for image classification. Unlike traditional methods based on image data-sets collected by simulation experiments, we collect a diverse data-set of drivers in different driving conditions and activity patterns from the Internet and train generative models for multiple driving scenarios. By sampling from these generative models, we augment the collected data-set with new training samples and train a Convolutional Neural Network for distraction recognition. We demonstrate that the generative models are able to generate images of drivers in different driving scenarios. With augmentative images, the DDR system achieves an improvement of 11.45% on image classification performance in a driving simulation environment. Moreover, we demonstrate how the trained DDR systems can be integrated within a driver monitoring system.",

    "abstract": "Connected vehicle applications rely on wireless communication for achieving real-time situational awareness and enabling automated actions or driver warnings. Given the constraints of the communication systems, it is critical to employ communication strategies and approaches that allow robust situational awareness. In this work, we utilize the recently introduced concept of model-based communication and design a new strategy based on small- and large-scale modeling of vehicle movement dynamics. Our approach is to describe the small-scale structure of the remote vehicle movement (e.g., braking, accelerating) by a set of dynamic models (ARX models) and represent the large-scale structure (e.g., free following, turning) by coupling these ARX models together into a Markov chain. The effect of this design is investigated for the case of cooperative adaptive cruise control application. Assuming model-based communication approach is used with the coupled model, a novel stochastic model predictive method is proposed to achieve cruise control goals. We use actual highway driving maneuvers to compare the proposed methodology with the conventional design of cooperative adaptive cruise control.",

    "abstract": "Connected vehicle technologies present new opportunities to minimize energy consumption in vehicles. Much of the prior work has focused on the impact of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication on energy savings. Here, we analyze the impact of connectivity on both energy savings and battery degradation reduction for an electric bus. Dynamic programming is employed to optimize the velocity profile of a single electric bus passing through a traffic intersection under a V2I regime wherein the intersection timing of the traffic light is known a priori. The optimization seeks to minimize the overall cost function consisting of the electric energy consumption and battery degradation. Simulations have been conducted for both the connected vehicle case and the baseline case without connectivity. Three different battery sizes were investigated, and the results indicate that connectivity confers the greatest cost savings for the smallest battery. An overall cost savings of 27% can be realized by using connectivity to reduce both energy consumption and battery degradation.",

In this paper, a method of behavior estimation is proposed to recognize and predict the lane change intentions based on the contextual traffic information. A model predictive controller is designed to optimize the acceleration sequences by incorporating the lane-change intentions of other vehicles. The public data set of next generation simulation is labeled and then published as a benchmarking platform for the research community. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate vehicle behavior and therefore outperform the traditional car-following control.",

    "abstract": "Continuous point cloud stitching provides accurate and rapid environmental information for mapping, which plays an essential role in autonomous vehicles. Many methods related to autonomous vehicles are either inaccurate or time-consuming when they reconstruct large scenes. In this work, a feature matching score-based stitching method to reconstruct environments for autonomous vehicles is proposed. The purpose of the method is to address the problems of stitching quality and time consumption by using the feature matchcompleteness scores. The feature matching score is obtained by calculating the matching rate within an adjacent image pairs that produces a frame of point cloud. The score maintains the correct points, so fewer points require to be stitched. Then, the corresponding criterion is given to evaluate the performance of stitching candidate point clouds. Finally, the points are fit into planes to form a complete and comprehensive scene. The proposed stitching algorithm was verified in several experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the overall system.",

However, challenges related to driving skill improvement of drivers exist because of the necessity of manual operation, and these are expected to continue in the future. Despite the fact that maintaining and improving manual driving performance will be indispensable in the near future, there are few studies on parking assistance systems aimed at improving the skills of the drivers. Therefore, we focused on steering timing as a candidate factor for skill improvement in reverse parking. In this article, we developed an assist method based on auditory presentation that indicates the timing for starting of steering in order to follow the target trajectory during reverse parking. From the results of verification tests of the assistance using the driving simulator, various effects such as improvement of driver's parking accuracy and reduction of workload were confirmed.",

    "abstract": "We present a particle-based framework for estimating the position of a vehicle using map information and measurements of speed. The filter propagates the particles' position estimates by means of dead-reckoning, and then updates the particle weights using two measurement functions. The first measurement function is based on the assumption that the lateral force on the vehicle does not exceed critical limits derived from physical constraints. The second is based on the assumption that the driver approaches a target speed derived from the speed limits along the upcoming trajectory. Assuming some prior knowledge of the initial position, performance evaluations of the proposed method indicate that end destinations often can be estimated with an accuracy in the order of 100 [m]. These results expose the sensitivity and commercial value of speed data collected in many of today's insurance telematics programs, where the data is used to adjust premiums and provide driver feedback. We end by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of different methods for anonymization and privacy preservation in telematics programs.",

    "abstract": "In face of the safety risk and ageing workforce in traditional mining industry, smart mining is becoming the new trend, especially the autonomous mining, which could completely address the safety issue while boosting efficiency. However, the lack of specific standards for the smart mining has led to the various types of equipment and high development costs. Therefore, we present the effort by Chinese mining research organizations and industrial enterprises in creating standards for automation and autonomy. Besides, we introduce a few key intelligent technologies for the autonomous mining transportation, and several current applications of autonomous trucks in mines around the world. These key intelligent technologies are likely to be further improved with following standards and become more affordable for mines.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a survey of the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) field when considering the recent evolution of autonomous driving. The growing interest regarding self-driving cars has given new directions to localization and mapping techniques. In this survey, we give an overview of the different branches of SLAM before going into the details of specific trends that are of interest when considered with autonomous applications in mind. We first present the limits of classical approaches for autonomous driving and discuss the criteria that are essential for this kind of application. We then review the methods where the identified challenges are tackled. We mostly focus on approaches building and reusing long-term maps in various conditions (weather, season, etc.). We also go through the emerging domain of multivehicle SLAM and its link with self-driving cars. We survey the different paradigms of that field (centralized and distributed) and the existing solutions. Finally, we conclude by giving an overview of the various large-scale experiments that have been carried out until now and discuss the remaining challenges and future orientations.",

    "publication_date": "March 2018",
    "abstract": "It is crucial to understand the surrounding cars with respect to the road context and interact with them harmoniously for the success of autonomous cars used in the mixed urban traffic. In this paper, a vision-based approach is proposed to implement the humanlike autonomous driving function along a predefined lane-level route in the complex urban environment with daily traffic. At first, the surrounding cars are located in the lane level by a deep neural network based detector with a low-cost lane graph. Subsequently, a Bayesian network is employed to classify the detected cars into six categories based on their states of operation, i.e., leader car, parked car, tail-end car, exiting car, merging car, and other car. Finally, a hybrid potential map, consisting of a trajectory-induction potential and a risk-prevention potential, is constructed for each of the cars according to their categories, which will be combined to be used for generating an appropriate behavior. Particularly, both of the trajectory-induction potentials and the risk-prevention potentials are learned from naturalistic driving data of the same situations in the daily urban traffic to encode the human driving skills and experiences. Therefore, the behavior generated based on the proposed learning-based potentials is close to a humanlike performance, which is important to achieve harmony in the mixed traffic. Experimental results in various typical but challenging urban traffic scenes have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

We illustrate our development of a complete perception and decision making system which addresses various challenges and propose an action planning method for highly automated vehicles which can merge into a roundabout. We use learning from demonstration to construct a classifier for high-level decision making, and develop a novel set of formulations that is suited to this challenging situation: multiple agents in a highly dynamic environment with interdependencies between agents, partial observability, and a limited amount of training data. Having limited amount of labeled training data is highly constraining, but a very real issue in real-world applications. We believe that our formulations are also well suited to other automated driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Traditional methods for autonomous driving are implemented with many building blocks from perception, planning and control, making them difficult to generalize to varied scenarios due to complex assumptions and interdependencies. Recently, the end-to-end driving method has emerged, which performs well and generalizes to new environments by directly learning from expert-provided data. However, many existing methods on this topic neglect to check the confidence of the driving actions and the ability to recover from driving mistakes. In this paper, we develop an uncertainty-aware end-to-end trajectory generation method based on imitation learning. It can extract spatiotemporal features from the front-view camera images for scene understanding, and then generate collision-free trajectories several seconds into the future. The experimental results suggest that under various weather and lighting conditions, our network can reliably generate trajectories in different urban environments, such as turning at intersections and slowing down for collision avoidance. Furthermore, closed-loop driving tests suggest that the proposed method achieves better cross-scene/platform driving results than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end control method, where our model can recover from off-center and off-orientation errors and capture 80% of dangerous cases with high uncertainty estimations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a supervised machine learning state estimation scheme that is able to estimate the current sideslip angle of a vehicle. It consists of a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units, an additional input projection and a regression head. This structure has been chosen to limit the computational complexity of the model while preserving the expressiveness of the overall system. It will also be shown how equations of a simplified vehicle model can be incorporated to make use of existing domain knowledge. The results show that the neural network is able to reach an excellent estimation quality while generalizing over different tires, surfaces, and driving situations. Comparisons of different model variants on selected data subsets allow us to draw conclusions on the adaptation to varying parameters and show a quality improvement through the physical model. Evaluations with the mean squared error are complemented by more expressive fit and error plots to give a better understanding of the model behavior. All data for this paper have been collected with a Porsche 911 Turbo (Type 991 II) with a series sensor setup and an additional reference sensor.",

    "abstract": "Safety on roads is of uttermost importance, especially in the context of autonomous vehicles. A critical need is to detect and communicate disruptive incidents early and effectively. In this paper we propose a system based on an off-the-shelf deep neural network architecture that is able to detect and recognize types of unsigned (non-placarded, such as traffic signs), physical (visible in images) road incidents. We develop a taxonomy for unsigned physical incidents to provide a means of organizing and grouping related incidents. After selecting eight target types of incidents, we collect a dataset of twelve thousand images gathered from publicly-available web sources. We subsequently fine-tune a convolutional neural network to recognize the eight types of road incidents. The proposed model is able to recognize incidents with a high level of accuracy (higher than 90%). We further show that while our system generalizes well across spatial context by training a classifier on geostratified data in the United Kingdom (with an accuracy of over 90%), the translation to visually less similar environments requires spatially distributed data collection.",

With the consideration of driving preferences and driver characteristics, these systems become more acceptable and trustworthy. This article presents a survey on recent advances in implicit personalized driving assistance. We classify the collection of work into three main categories: 1) personalized Safe Driving Systems (SDS), 2) personalized Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS), and 3) personalized In-vehicle Information Systems (IVIS). For each category, we provide a comprehensive review of current applications and related techniques along with the discussion of industry status, benefits of personalization, application prospects, and future focal points. Both relevant driving datasets and open issues about personalized driving assistance are discussed to facilitate future research. By creating an organized categorization of the field, we hope that this survey could not only support future research and the development of new technologies for personalized driving assistance but also facilitate the application of these techniques within the driving automation community.",

    "abstract": "We propose an urban traffic management scheme for an all connected vehicle environment. If all the vehicles are autonomous, for example, in smart city projects or future's dense city centers, then such an environment does not need a physical traffic signal. Instead, an intersection control server processes data streams from approaching vehicles, periodically solves an optimization problem, and assigns to each vehicle an optimal arrival time that ensures safety while significantly reducing number of stops and intersection delays. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), and is solved by IBM CPLEX optimization package. The optimization outputs (scheduled access/arrival times) are sent to all approaching vehicles. The autonomous vehicles adjust their speed accordingly by a proposed trajectory planning algorithm with the aim of accessing the intersection at their scheduled times. A customized traffic microsimulation environment is developed to determine the potentials of the proposed solution in comparison to two baseline scenarios. In addition, the proposed MILP-based intersection control scheme is modified and simulated for a mixed traffic consisting of autonomous and human-controlled vehicles, all connected through a wireless communication to the intersection controller of a signalized intersection.",

    "abstract": "Tightly coupling GNSS pseudorange and Doppler measurements with other sensors is known to increase the accuracy and consistency of positioning information. Nowadays, high-accuracy geo-referenced lane marking maps are seen as key information sources in autonomous vehicle navigation. When an exteroceptive sensor such as a video camera or a lidar is used to detect them, lane markings provide positioning information which can be merged with GNSS data. In this paper, measurements from a forward-looking video camera are merged with raw GNSS pseudoranges and Dopplers on visible satellites. To create a localization system that provides pose estimates with high availability, dead reckoning sensors are also integrated. The data fusion problem is then formulated as sequential filtering. A reduced-order state space modeling of the observation problem is proposed to give a real-time system that is easy to implement. A Kalman filter with measured input and correlated noises is developed using a suitable error model of the GNSS pseudoranges. Our experimental results show that this tightly coupled approach performs better, in terms of accuracy and consistency, than a loosely coupled method using GNSS fixes as inputs.",

Simulation systems must be able to emulate a variety of sensors including cameras and LiDARs in order to allow high-level software such as image processing and path planning to be tested. In this paper, we present a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system without real-time constraints. It is based on CARLA to give access to the sensors required to test high-level software, and incorporates compute hardware identical to that used on an autonomous vehicle platform in order to provide realistic constraints regarding available processing power. In addition, we explore the robot operating system based software framework used on the Formula SAE vehicle and its integration with the driving simulator. Finally, we validate the sensor outputs and vehicle dynamics of the simulated system against a physical autonomous driving hardware platform.",

This paper attempts to solve those challenges and demonstrates a successful implementation of randomized MPC on the autonomous driving using a radio-controlled (RC) car. First of all, a sample generation technique in the frequency domain is discussed. This prevents undesirable randomness which affect the smoothness of the steering operation. Second, the proposed randomized MPC is implemented on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The expected GPU acceleration in calculation speed at various problem sizes is also presented. The results show the improved control performance and computational speed that was not achievable using CPU based implementation. Besides, the selection of parameters for randomized MPC is discussed. The usefulness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by both simulation and experiments. In the experiments, a 1/10 model RC car is used for collision avoidance task by autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "Continuous estimation the driver's take-over readiness is critical for safe and timely transfer of control during the failure modes of autonomous vehicles. In this article, we propose a data-driven approach for estimating the driver's take-over readiness based purely on observable cues from in-vehicle vision sensors. We present an extensive naturalistic driving dataset of drivers in a conditionally autonomous vehicle running on Californian freeways. We collect subjective ratings for the driver's take-over readiness from multiple human observers viewing the sensor feed. Analysis of the ratings in terms of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) shows a high degree of consistency in the ratings across raters. We define a metric for the driver's take-over readiness termed the `Observable Readiness Index (ORI)' based on the ratings. Finally, we propose an LSTM model for continuous estimation of the driver's ORI based on a holistic representation of the driver's state, capturing gaze, hand, pose and foot activity. Our model estimates the ORI with a mean absolute error of 0.449 on a 5 point scale.",

Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in computational requirements. The side by side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assists with system level design choices.",

    "abstract": "Lane-level map matching is essential for autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for matching a trajectory of noisy GPS measurements to the road lanes in which the vehicle records its positions. To our knowledge, this is the first time that HMM is used for lane-level map matching. Apart from GPS values, the model is further assisted by yaw rate data (converted to a lane change indicator signal) and visual cues in the form of the left and right lane marking types (dashed, solid, etc.). Having defined expressions for the HMM emission and transition probabilities, we evaluate our model to demonstrate that it achieves 95.1% recall and 3.3% median path length error for motorway trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology and has been introduced into intelligent driving and transportation systems to digitize and synergize connected automated vehicles. However, existing studies focus on the design of the automated vehicle, whereas the digitization of the human driver, who plays an important role in driving, is largely ignored. Furthermore, previous driver-related tasks are limited to specific scenarios and have limited applicability. Thus, a novel concept of a driver digital twin (DDT) is proposed in this study to bridge the gap between existing automated driving systems and fully digitized ones and aid in the development of a complete driving human cyber-physical system (H-CPS). This concept is essential for constructing a harmonious human-centric intelligent driving system that considers the proactivity and sensitivity of the human driver. The primary characteristics of the DDT include multimodal state fusion, personalized modeling, and time variance. Compared with the original DT, the proposed DDT emphasizes on internal personality and capability with respect to the external physiological-level state. This study systematically illustrates the DDT and outlines its key enabling aspects. The related technologies are comprehensively reviewed and discussed with a view to improving them by leveraging the DDT. In addition, the potential applications and unsettled challenges are considered. This study aims to provide fundamental theoretical support to researchers in determining the future scope of the DDT system",

    "abstract": "Left turn across path crashes with a vehicle traveling from the opposite direction (LTAP/OD) are a common and often fatal intersection crash scenario in the U.S. Intersection advanced driver assistance systems (I-ADAS) are active safety systems emerging in the vehicle fleet that are intended to help drivers safely traverse intersections. The objective of this study was to examine the earliest detection opportunity for I-ADAS in LTAP/OD intersection crashes. A total of 35 crashes were extracted for this study's analysis from the NASS/CDS crash database. EDR precrash records taken from each vehicle were then used to determine vehicle position with respect to time. Two scenarios are considered: one with and one without potential sight occlusions. The results suggest that, even if no sight obstructions are present, an I-ADAS that warns drivers of an impending collision will be greatly limited by perception-reaction time. Accordingly, systems that employ automated emergency braking are expected to be substantially more effective. Required detection distances and azimuth values are presented. The results highlight the need for careful tuning of sensor capabilities and the need to consider side-facing sensors for ensuring vehicle tracking prior to any potential collision conflict.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the effectiveness and benefits of driver assistance systems is crucial for improving the system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for testing and evaluating lane departure correction systems at a low cost by using lane departure events reproduced from naturalistic driving data. First, 529 096 lane departure events were extracted from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment database collected by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Second, a stochastic lane departure model consisting of eight random key variables was developed to reduce the dimension of the data description and improve the computational efficiency. With this purpose, we used a bounded Gaussian mixture model to describe drivers' stochastic lane departure behaviors. Then, a lane departure correction system with an aim point controller was designed, and a batch of lane departure events was reproduced from the learned stochastic driver model. Finally, we assessed the developed evaluation approach by comparing lateral departure areas of vehicles between with and without correction controllers. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate lane departure correction systems.",

    "publication_date": "March 2018",
    "abstract": "Designing autonomous vehicles for urban environments remains an unresolved problem. One major dilemma faced by autonomous cars is understanding the intention of other road users and communicating with them. To investigate one aspect of this, specifically pedestrian crossing behavior, we have collected a large dataset of pedestrian samples at crosswalks under various conditions (e.g., weather) and in different types of roads. Using the data, we analyzed pedestrian behavior from two different perspectives: the way they communicate with drivers prior to crossing and the factors that influence their behavior. Our study shows that changes in head orientation in the form of looking or glancing at the traffic is a strong indicator of crossing intention. We also found that context in the form of the properties of a crosswalk (e.g., its width), traffic dynamics (e.g., speed of the vehicles) as well as pedestrian demographics can alter pedestrian behavior after the initial intention of crossing has been displayed. Our findings suggest that the contextual elements can be interrelated, meaning that the presence of one factor may increase/decrease the influence of other factors. Overall, our work formulates the problem of pedestrian-driver interaction and sheds light on its complexity in typical traffic scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Merging into the flow of high-speed traffic on roadways, such as expressways, is a demanding driving task for nonexpert drivers. The difficulty of merging is thought to arise from the difficulty of judging the location where the drivers should merge. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model of driver decisionmaking that can predict the location where the driver will merge. In addition, we demonstrate that the entropy of the judgment introduced based on the proposed model has the ability to describe the differences in skills of judgment in merging position as well as the difficulty of decision-making in a given situation. Furthermore, we propose a driver assistance method to decrease the difficulty of decision-making with respect to the merging position during the preparation phase based on the proposed decision-making model when the difficulty is judged as being higher than a given threshold. The proposed method recommends acceleration or deceleration to increase the clarity of judgment. Driving simulator experiments demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the difficulty of decision-making for merging and increases the ease of judgment at the early stages of merging preparation. In addition, the proposed method decreases mental demand without leading to an increase in the overall workload, that is, the weighted workload of NASA-TLX.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory planning for a tractor-trailer vehicle is challenging due to the non-convex collision avoidance constraints and the unstable kinematics. This article aims to plan precise and optimal trajectory for a car-like tractor that tows standard or general N-trailers in an environment with static obstacles. This trajectory planning scheme can be formulated as a unified optimal control problem, but numerically solving that problem is difficult. Two efforts are made to address the difficulty. First, an extended hybrid A* search algorithm is proposed to provide an initial guess for the numerical optimization. Second, the numerical optimization process is eased through adopting a progressively constrained optimization strategy, which is about sequentially handling the kinematics, collision avoidance constraints, and boundary conditions. Particularly in dealing with the collision avoidance constraints, an adaptively homotopic warm-starting algorithm is proposed, which defines a sequence of subproblems with the obstacle areas adaptively increase towards their nominal scales. Through solving these subproblems in a sequence, the whole collision avoidance difficulties are dispersed and gradually tackled. Comparative simulations are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed trajectory planner.",

    "publication_date": "March 2021",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a vision-based collision-warning system for ADAS in intelligent vehicles, with a focus on urban scenarios. In most current systems, collision warnings are based on radar, or on monocular vision using pattern recognition. Since detecting collisions is a core functionality of intelligent vehicles, redundancy is essential, so that we explore the use of stereo vision. First, our approach is generic and class-agnostic, since it can detect general obstacles that are on a colliding path with the ego-vehicle without relying on semantic information. The framework estimates disparity and flow from a stereo video stream and calculates stixels. Then, the second contribution is the use of the new asteroids concept as a consecutive step. This step samples particles based on a probabilistic uncertainty analysis of the measurement process to model potential collisions. Third, this is all enclosed in a Bayesian histogram filter around a newly introduced time-to-collision versus angle-of-impact state space. The evaluation shows that the system correctly avoids any false warnings on the real-world KITTI dataset, detects all collisions in a newly simulated dataset when the obstacle is higher than 0.4 m, and performs excellent on our new qualitative real-world data with near-collisions, both in daytime and nighttime conditions.",

    "abstract": "In order to develop safe autonomous systems, accurate and precise models of human behavior must be developed. For intelligent vehicles, one can imagine the need for predicting driver behavior to develop minimally invasive active safety systems or to safely interact with human drivers on the road. We present an optimization-based method for approximating the stochastic reachable set for human-in-the-loop systems. This method identifies the most precise subset of states that a human driven vehicle may enter, given some data set of observed trajectories. We phrase this problem as a mixed integer linear program, solved via branch and bound methods. The resulting model uncovers the most representative set that encapsulates the likely trajectories, up to some probability threshold, by optimally rejecting outliers in the data set. This tool provides set predictions consisting of trajectories observed from the nonlinear dynamics and behaviors of the human driven car, and can account for modes of behavior, like the driver state or intent. This method is applied to predict lane changing behavior, achieving $\\sim$90% accuracy over long time horizons. This flexible algorithm is to handle realistic complex human driving data and provide a robust and informative prediction of driver behavior.",

    "abstract": "Automated driving systems have been released in recent years to improve the active safety. In this research field, a preview/predictive driver model has been widely used as a steering controller and for driver behavior analysis. This driver model has been implemented by many researchers and, through the vehicle simulations and experiments, has been shown to reproduce driver behavior, such as the driver's steering and handle torque. On the other hand, optical flow is a part of visual information, and in our previous works we focused on it as the index used in human locomotor behavior. Humans are known to perceive the direction of their self-motion from optical flow and utilize it during driving. In experimental applications of the optical flow model to an in-vehicle system, the system was shown to be effective in practical use. In particular, the system can express the same driver behavior as the preview driver model. In this study, the preview driver model was analyzed from the viewpoint of optical flow to understand the preview driver model's interpretation of human behavior. In addition, in this paper a new preview driver model that utilizes our knowledge of optical flow is proposed. This model shows a better control performance and ride quality than the conventional preview driver model. As a result, this approach serves as a foundation of the preview driver model.",

    "abstract": "We benchmark several widely-used deep learning frameworks and investigate the field programmable gate array (FPGA) deployment for performing traffic sign classification and detection. We evaluate the training speed and inference accuracy of these frameworks on the graphics processing unit (GPU) by training FPGA-deployment-suitable models with various input sizes on German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), a traffic sign classification dataset. Then, selected trained classification models and various object detection models that we train on GTSRB's detection counterpart (i.e., German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark) are evaluated with inference speed, accuracy, and FPGA power efficiency by varying different parameters such as floating-point precisions, batch sizes, etc. We discover that Neon and MXNet deliver the best training speed and classification accuracy on the GPU in general for all test cases, while TensorFlow is always among the frameworks with the highest inference accuracies. We observe that with the current OpenVINO release, the performance of lightweight models (e.g., MobileNet-v1-SSD, etc.) usually exceeds the requirement of real-time detection without losing much accuracy, while other models (e.g., VGG-SSD, ResNet50-SSD) generally fail to do so. We also demonstrate that we can adjust the precision of bitstreams and the batch sizes to balance inference speed and accuracy of the applications deployed on the FPGA. Finally, we show that for all test cases, the FPGA always achieves higher power efficiency than the GPU.",

For this reason, many machine learning approaches have been developed and applied. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a suitable algorithm due to its ability to handle time series data and state transition descriptions. Therefore, this contribution will focus on a review of HMM and its applications. The aim of this contribution is to analyze the current state of various driving behavior models and related HMM-based algorithms. By examining the current available approaches, a review is provided with respect to: i) influencing factors of driving behaviors corresponding to the research objectives of different driving models, ii) summarizing HMM related methods applied to driving behavior studies, and iii) discussing limitations, issues, and future potential works of the HMM-based algorithms. Conclusions with respect to the development of intelligent driving assistant system and vehicle dynamics control systems are given.",

    "publication_date": "March 2020",
    "abstract": "Ride comfort and road holding are two substantial performance criteria related to the suspension system of road vehicles. These performance criteria are critical in controller design and chassis stability of automated driving vehicles. Control demands in terms of accuracy, quick response and robustness to matched and mismatched uncertainties are suggestive of employing adaptive robust controllers. Herein, a state observer-based modified sliding mode interval fuzzy type-2 neural network (FT2NN) controller is designed to suppress the vibrations from a typical rough terrain imposed to the nonlinear suspension system of the vehicles. The nonlinear system dynamics are estimated using the universal approximation capacity of the neuro-fuzzy type-2 approach and the states are obtained by the adaptive robust state observer. The membership functions (MFs) of the fuzzy type-2 system are employed to deal with the uncertainties through variable mean and variances for upper and lower MFs. Furthermore, the proposed controller has the advantage of relaxing the condition for the approximation error boundaries while the estimation step is utilized to observe the boundaries adaptively. A new adaptive compensator is employed to withstand the effect of the external disturbance, the approximation errors related to the unknown nonlinear functions and state estimations. The results obtained from the proposed controller are suggestive of the higher effectiveness of the proposed controller compared to the tested Neuro-PID controller, and also the passive suspension system. The high-fidelity MSC ADAMS based co-simulations were implemented to validate the practicality of the proposed controller.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent vehicles offer hope for a world in which crashes are rare, congestion is reduced, carbon emissions are decreased, and mobility is extended to a wider population. As long as humans are in the loop, over a half century of research in human factors suggests that this hope is unlikely to become a reality unless careful attention is paid to human behavior and, conversely, the potential for harm is real if little attention is given to said behavior. Different challenges lie with each of the two middle levels of automation which are the primary focus of this article. With Level 2 automation (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; NHTSA), the driver is removed from always having to control the position and speed of the vehicle, but is still required to monitor both position and speed. Humans are notoriously bad at vigilance tasks, and can quickly lose situation awareness. Moreover, even if vigilant, the driver needs to interact with the vehicle. But voice-activated systems which let the driver continue to glance at the forward roadway are proving to be a potential source of cognitive distraction. With Level 3 automation (NHTSA), the driver is out of the loop most of the time, but will still need to interact with the vehicle. Critical skills can be lost over time. Unexpected transfers of control need to be considered. The surface transportation and aviation human factors communities have proposed ways to solve the problems that will inevitably arise, either through careful experimentation or extensions of existing research.",

A dataset is constituted by time stamped and geographically referenced driving maneuver information, which is exceptionally reported when an acceleration exceeds the given threshold in both longitudinal and lateral direction. Risk level is labeled in terms of the change in total vehicle collision property damage cost for the analyzed time period, and long term driving activities' magnitude and frequency is divided into two equal time periods, which are used to predict risk levels. Redistribution of conflicts generated by driving activities is used to predict the future risk level of involvement in an accident. Using fuzzy approach a microaveraged F-measure 90.98% is achieved by Dubois-Parade and PCR6 conflict redistribution methods.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2018.2886677",
    "publication_date": "March 2019",
    "abstract": "Cooperative driving is an essential component of future intelligent road systems. It promises greater safety, reducing accidents due to drivers distraction, improved infrastructure utilization, and fuel consumption reduction with platooning applications. Proper platoon management requires inter-vehicular communication (IVC), longitudinal control and lateral control for stability and safety, and proper application protocols and algorithms to manage platoons and perform coordinated maneuvers. This paper shows, how a longitudinal controller based on distributed consensus can, at the same time, guarantee stability and performance in regime platoon operations, and be at the hearth of maneuvering protocols and algorithms, as it remains stable in face of changes of platoon topology and control gains. The adoption of a single control algorithm for two fundamental tasks greatly simplify the overall design of the system and improves stability and safety as it is not required to switch between different controllers during platoon operation. The theoretical properties are proven in the first part of the paper. The second part of the paper is devoted to its implementation in a state-of-the-art mobility and IVC simulator, which is used for an extensive experimental campaign showing the dynamic properties of the system and its performance in a set of typical platoon maneuvers as join, leave, and inclusion of a vehicle in the middle of the platoon. All simulations include realistic details of the vehicle dynamics (mass, dimensions, power train dynamics) as well as extremely detailed modeling of the communication network, from IEEE 802.11p protocol details, to collisions, packet errors, path loss and fading on the channel, and source-destination-based delays.",

    "abstract": "Lane marking detection is a fundamental yet challenging task for traffic scene understanding. Previous works generally predict traffic line segmentation and obtain lane marking coordinates with a post-processing step, which are vulnerable to various challenging environments including occlusion, illumination variation, shadow, background clutter. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named as Lane marking Regression Network (LRN), which can simultaneously consider confidence area detection and field inference for producing more precise lane markings in an unified encoder-decoder framework. For obtaining confidence detection of lane area, we introduce the graph diffusion mechanism to aggregate the contextual information for better detecting hard areas. The field inference considers the geometric relationship between lane area and lane markings by adopting a novel constraint regression function. Comprehensive evaluations on CULane and GD datasets well demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed LRN over other state-of-the-arts for lane marking detection.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will revolutionise city design, and radically affect how people move. The scenario of AVs taking users to their destinations and then conveniently dropping them off is an obvious advantage, reducing the need for drivers to waste time car parking. However, it is not so clear how AVs need to behave when dropping off passengers at busy drop-off areas, since there are a number of possible options, from simply waiting for a spot at the drop off area, circulating till a slot is available at a drop-off area to actually parking further, depending on the situation at the drop-off area and passenger preferences. In this paper, we propose and investigate a cooperative drop-off (CDO) approach. CDO can handle the unpredictable circumstances of a drop-off situation using vehicle cooperation and makes rational collective decisions with the goal of minimizing the arrival time of passengers. Comprehensive simulation of a range of aspects is used to assess and examine different factors affecting the CDO approach, and it is shown to provide reasonable performance under different conditions.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2021",
    "abstract": "Recent progress in radar development enable high-resolution radar sensors to resolve multiple detections for an extended object. One of the main challenges in radar-based object detection and tracking is the handling of an uncertain measurement model problem dealing with wandering dominant scatter points on the extended object surface depending on the relative orientation and motion. This phenomenon needs to be considered for near extended object tracking in critical driving situations, e.g., for safety applications, which require fast and accurate target state estimation in high dynamic scenarios. This paper presents a method to detect rotating wheels of approaching targets. Using the position and velocity of detected wheels as input for a tracking procedure, instead of target detections, relaxes the uncertain measurement model problem. A generic radar signal processing method to detect the position and bulk velocities of rotating wheels for approaching target vehicles is presented. The method evaluates the micro-Doppler signals, generated by rotating wheels, of close targets. These wheel hypotheses serve as input for a subsequent sequential Monte Carlo tracking framework. The presented methods are evaluated on real experimental data where a target vehicle is used to reconstruct safety-critical dynamic evading maneuvers.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale synthetic traffic image datasets have been widely used to make compensate for the insufficient data in real world. However, the mismatch in domain distribution between synthetic datasets and real datasets hinders the application of the synthetic dataset in the actual vision system of intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel synthetic-to-real domain adaptation method to settle the mismatch domain distribution from two aspects, i.e., data level and knowledge level. On the data level, a Style-Content Discriminated Data Recombination (SCD-DR) module is proposed, which decouples the style from content and recombines style and content from different domains to generate a hybrid domain as a transition between synthetic and real domains. On the knowledge level, a novel Iterative Cross-Domain Knowledge Transferring (ICD-KT) module including source knowledge learning, knowledge transferring and knowledge refining is designed, which achieves not only effective domain-invariant feature extraction, but also transfers the knowledge from labeled synthetic images to unlabeled actual images. Comprehensive experiments on public virtual and real dataset pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approach in object detection of traffic scenes.",

    "abstract": "Driving automation systems typically use surround sensors to perceive their local environment. Accidents with automated vehicles have shown that errors in sensor data measurement and interpretation can lead to fatal injuries. It is thus necessary to test the reliability of environmental perception systems before market introduction. Since critical weather conditions are random, rare, and change quickly, relevant data sets are biased towards clear conditions. Consequently, detection algorithms based on these data suffer from limited performance. This article focuses on a two-step approach based on a) an indoor rain facility to test under reproducible, realistic conditions and b) physical-based models to enrich sensor data from clear conditions with virtual rain effects in a post-processing step. We concentrate on data from camera, lidar, and radar sensors. Experimental results show that both approaches simulate critical effects on raw sensor data and, therefore, enable replicable testing and validation at every stage of development.",

    "publication_date": "March 2022",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate a common design methodology to derive an adaptive cruise control algorithm in order to compensate the effect of the lower level time-lag on the stability. Here the dynamics of the vehicle is approximated by a first order system. The lower level time-lag is referred to the lag associated with the vehicle dynamics to attain the desired condition computed by the adaptive cruise controller. Inclusion of such dynamics reduces the performance of an adaptive cruise control system, both locally and collectively. The solutions presented here can be applied to design a new adaptive cruise control model or to extend any model with velocity dependent spacing function. The derived design method fulfills the over-damped string stability condition in presence of a time-lag in the plant, irrespective of the choice of the equilibrium operating point of linearization. The over-damped characteristic improves both safety and performance. To demonstrate the application of the presented method, two existing models are extended using the derived strategy, viz. the variable time gap and the quadratic range policy. Later the extended models are simulated with rigorous driving conditions, in order to illustrate the improvements in comparison with the respective original models as well as with the extended models using an existing compensation strategy.",

These sensors can include a combination of cameras, LiDARs, GPS, IMU, and odometric sensors to achieve positioning and localisation for the vehicle and nearby objects in their environment and can be challenging to integrate. In this paper, we present a hybridised software framework that combines sensor and navigational processing for autonomous driving. Our framework utilises a modular approach for interfacing and safety functionality, whilst navigation and sensor interfaces are implemented as nodes in the robot operating system. Our testing results verify the suitability of our framework by integration with a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system and for fully autonomous field driving.",

    "abstract": "The lane-change strategy of autonomous vehicles is affected by its leading vehicle. It is necessary and challenging to simultaneously conduct the lane-change maneuvers while avoiding collisions with the leading vehicle. This article proposes a lane-change strategy considering the leading vehicle by synthesizing vehicle velocity prediction, motion planning, and trajectory tracking control. A scenario-based velocity prediction method using the input-output hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed to predict the leading vehicle velocity. Then a motion planner integrating the predicted velocity is developed to generate the optimal trajectories for the lane-change maneuvers. The generated trajectories are tracked by a trajectory tracking controller. An improved composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control algorithm is proposed to obtain smooth transient performances and fast responses. Human driver tests on a driving simulator show the leading vehicle velocity can be predicted by the proposed method. The motion planner and the trajectory tracking controller are validated in the CarSim simulations. The collision-free optimal trajectories are generated and tracked by the motion planner and the improved CNF controller. A systematic lane-change strategy considering the leading vehicle is effectively developed in this study.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) improves road throughput by employing intervehicle wireless communications. The inherent communication time delay and vehicle actuator delay significantly limit the minimum intervehicle distance in view of string stability requirements. Hence, controller design needs to consider both delays, which result in a nonrational transfer function representation of the CACC-controlled string. Padé approximations can be applied to arrive at a finite-dimensional model, which allows for many standard control methods. Our objective is to provide a method to decide for the lowest possible order of the Padé approximation, which is sufficiently accurate in view of CACC (string) stability analysis. The constant time gap strategy and a one-vehicle look-ahead topology are adopted to develop a CACC stable string. First, based on the stable controller parameter region, a suitable order of Padé approximations of the vehicle actuator delay can been carried out in view of individual vehicle stability. Then, the minimum string-stable time gaps for a CACC system with both exact and approximated delays have been compared. The procedure with a Proportional-derivative controller to choose the approximation order of delays has been given, followed by the time-domain simulation validation.",

    "abstract": "Navigation maps provide critical information for advanced driving assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. When these maps are refined to lane-level, ambiguities may occur during the map-matching process, particularly when positioning estimates are inaccurate. This paper presents a dead-reckoning method implementing a particle filter to estimate a set of likely map-matched hypotheses containing the correct solution with a high probability. Our method uses lane-level maps that feature dedicated attributes such as connectedness and adjacency. The vehicle position is essentially estimated by dead-reckoning sensors and lane detection using an intelligent camera. We also describe an integrity monitoring method for assessing the coherence of the set of hypotheses, using the fix of a global navigation satellite system receiver. The method provides in real-time a “Use/Don't Use” characterization of the vehicle positioning information that is transmitted to safety functions, where integrity is fundamental. The performance of the proposed map-aided dead-reckoning method with integrity monitoring is evaluated using data acquired by an experimental car on suburban public roads. The results obtained validate the approach.",

    "publication_date": "March 2021",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a unified optimization-based path planning approach to efficiently compute locally optimal solutions to optimal path planning problems in unstructured environments. The approach is motivated by showing that a lattice-based planner can be cast and analyzed as a bilevel optimization problem. This insight is used to integrate a lattice-based planner and an optimal control-based method in a novel way. The lattice-based planner is applied to the problem in a first step using a discretized search space. In a second step, an optimal control-based method is applied using the lattice-based solution as an initial iterate. In contrast to prior work, the system dynamics and objective function used in the first step are chosen to coincide with those used in the second step. As an important consequence, the lattice planner provides a solution which is highly suitable as a warm-start to the optimal control step. This proposed combination makes, in a structured way, benefit of sampling-based methods ability to solve combinatorial parts of the problem and optimal control-based methods ability to obtain locally optimal solutions. Compared to previous work, the proposed approach is shown in simulations to provide significant improvements in terms of computation time, numerical reliability and objective function value.",

The objectives of truck automation are energy saving and enhanced transportation capacity by platooning, and eventually possible reduction of personnel cost by unmanned operation of following vehicles. The sensing technologies for automated vehicle control are computer vision, radar, lidar, laser scanners, localization by GNSS, and vehicle to vehicle communications. Experiments of platooning of three or four heavy trucks have shown the effectiveness of platooning in achieving energy saving due to short gaps between vehicles.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of deep neural networks attempts to go deeper through the layered architecture to solve complex problems. As expected, the deepening impacts the processing times for inferences in tasks like object classification and localization. This demands solutions for balancing computational resource requirements and extend the versatility of a given model to suit a variety of applications. Often the solutions rely on architectural modifications to ease training times while achieving more accurate results. In this work, we propose a multistage algorithm with an initial stage adopting the YOLOv3 network for object detection and HART approach for object tracking. This is followed by an adaptive post-localization stage shift system taking into consideration the processing times of stage inferences, which are the number of located objects in image sequences. The goal is to change the localization strategy to achieve optimal processing time performance. For evaluation, we present results in terms of precision and processing times in varying traffic conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive multistage model in comparison to other real-time state-of-the-art detection strategies, as it achieves a frame rate gain of 49% over YOLOv3 while maintaining competitive task accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Manufacturers of safety-critical systems must make the case that their product is sufficiently safe for public deployment. Much of this case often relies upon critical event outcomes from real-world testing, requiring manufacturers to be strategic about how they allocate testing resources in order to maximize their chances of demonstrating system safety. This paper frames the partially observable and the belief-dependent problem of test scheduling as a Markov decision process, which can be solved efficiently to yield closed-loop manufacturer testing policies. By solving for policies over a wide range of problem formulations, we are able to provide high-level guidance for manufacturers and regulators on issues relating to the testing of safety-critical systems. This guidance spans an array of topics, including circumstances under which manufacturers should continue testing despite observed incidents, when manufacturers should test aggressively, and when regulators should increase or reduce the real-world testing requirements for safety-critical systems.",

    "abstract": "Drivers often engage in secondary in-vehicle activities that can be functional and/or to relieve monotony. Drivers believe they can safely do so when their perceived workload is low. However, driving requires concurrent execution of cognitive, physical, perceptual and motor tasks. Over allocation of a driver's attention to secondary tasks may impair the driver's control of the vehicle and attention to the surrounding traffic. Accurate assessment of a driver's workload is an important, but challenging, research topic with many applications in intelligent vehicle systems related to driving safety and enhance driving experience. In this article, we present our research on driver workload detection based on driver's physiological, vehicle signals as well as traffic contexts such as congestion level and traffic events. We obtained a collection of data from real driving scenarios. Twenty participants were recruited, whose workload was scaled to “low” as a base level, and “elevated” as a higher level. We developed two convolutional neural networks for multivariate temporal series (MTS-CNN). Extensive experiments were conducted in two scopes: within driver and cross-driver. The within-driver scope concentrates on experiments using data from a single driver, while in the cross-driver scope, transfer learning is leveraged and discussed. The experimental results demonstrate that one of the proposed models, i.e., MTS-CNN2, which combines features captured by the convolutional layers at all levels, is capable of learning well from the combined temporal physiological and vehicle signals and obtains the best performance.",

    "abstract": "Risk assessment is a central element for the development and validation of autonomous vehicles. It comprises a combination of occurrence probability and severity of future critical events. Time headway (TH) as well as time-to-contact (TTC) are commonly used risk metrics and have qualitative relations to occurrence probability. However, they lack theoretical derivations and additionally they are designed to only cover special types of traffic scenarios (e.g., longitudinal following between single car pairs). In this paper, we present a probabilistic situation risk model based on survival analysis considerations and extend it to naturally incorporate sensory, temporal, and behavioral uncertainties as they arise in real-world scenarios. The resulting risk spot detector (RSD) is applied and tested on naturalistic driving data of a multilane boulevard with several intersections, enabling the visualization of road criticality maps. Compared to TH and TTC, our approach is more selective and specific in predicting risk. RSD concentrates on driving sections of high vehicle density where large accelerations and decelerations or approaches with high velocity occur.",

    "abstract": "A method for achieving lane-level localization in global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-challenged environments is presented. The proposed method uses the pseudoranges drawn from unknown ambient cellular towers as an exclusive aiding source for a vehicle-mounted light detection and ranging (lidar) sensor. The following scenario is considered. A vehicle aiding its lidar with GNSS signals enters an environment where these signals become unusable. The vehicle is equipped with a receiver capable of producing pseudoranges to unknown cellular towers in its environment. These pseudoranges are fused through an extended Kalman filter to aid the lidar odometry, while estimating the vehicle's own state (3-D position and orientation) simultaneously with the position of the cellular towers and the difference between the receiver's and cellular towers’ clock error states (bias and drift). The proposed method is computationally efficient and is demonstrated to achieve lane-level accuracy in different environments. Simulation and experimental results with the proposed method are presented illustrating a close match between the vehicle's true trajectory and estimated using the cellular-aided lidar odometry over a 1 km trajectory. The proposed method yielded a 68% reduction in the 2-D position root mean-squared error (RMSE) over lidar odometry-only.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative computing is promising to enhance the performance and safety of autonomous vehicles benefiting from the increase in the amount, diversity as well as scope of data resources. However, effective and privacy-preserving utilization of multi-modal and multi-source data remains an open challenge during the construction of cooperative mechanisms. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated their potential in the unified representation of multi-modal features, which provides a new perspective for effective representation and fusion of diverse inputs of intelligent vehicles. Federated learning proposes a distributed learning scheme and is hopeful to achieve privacy-secure sharing of data resources among different vehicles. Towards privacy-preserving computing and cooperation in autonomous driving, this paper reviews recent progress of Transformers, federated learning as well as cooperative perception, and proposes a hierarchical structure of Transformers for intelligent vehicles which is comprised of Vehicular Transformers, Federated Vehicular Transformers and the Federation of Vehicular Transformers to exploit their potential in privacy-preserving collaboration.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art stixel methods fuse dense stereo disparity and semantic class information, e.g., from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), into a compact representation of driveable space, obstacles and background. However, they do not explicitly differentiate instances within the same semantic class. We investigate several ways to augment single-frame stixels with instance information, which can be extracted by a CNN from the RGB image input. As a result, our novel Instance Stixels method efficiently computes stixels that account for boundaries of individual objects, and represents instances as grouped stixels that express connectivity. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that including instance information into the stixel computation itself, rather than as a post-processing step, increases the segmentation performance (i.e., Intersection over Union and Average Precision). This holds especially for overlapping objects of the same class. Furthermore, we show the superiority of our approach in terms of segmentation performance and computational efficiency compared to combining the separate outputs of Semantic Stixels and a state-of-the-art pixel-level CNN. We achieve processing throughput of 28 frames per second on average for 8 pixel wide stixels on images from the Cityscapes dataset at 1792 × 784 pixels. Our Instance Stixels software is made freely available for non-commercial research purposes.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the development of a system to detect if a nearby car poses a collision danger to a bicycle, and to sound a loud horn to alert the car driver if a collision danger is detected. A sensing and estimation system suitable for use on a bicycle is therefore developed in order to track the trajectories of vehicles in a traffic intersection. An inexpensive solid-state low-density Lidar mounted at the front of an instrumented bicycle is used. The low angular resolution of the sensor creates many challenges. These challenges are addressed in this research by clustering based approaches for assigning measurement points to individual vehicles, by introducing a correction term with its own dynamic model for position measurement refinement, and by incorporating multi-target tracking using global nearest neighbor data association and interacting multiple model extended Kalman filtering. The tracking performance of the developed system is evaluated by both simulation and experimental results. Scenarios that involve straight driving (in all four directions) and left turning (opposing) vehicles at a traffic intersection are considered. Experimental results show that the developed system can successfully track cars accurately in these scenarios in spite of the low measurement resolution of the sensor.",

    "abstract": "Driving safety is quite significant for human drivers, especially in the emergencies and extreme conditions. To advance the active safety of vehicles, a cooperative control framework is proposed for human driver and the active rear steering system (ARS). Human driver model is established considering different driving characteristics to simulate different drivers. Moreover, vehicle-road model is built for ARS controller design. Then, the performance indexes of active safety, i.e., lateral stability, handling performance, rollover prevention and path tracking performance, are defined. Meanwhile, constraints for ARS controller design are proposed. Furthermore, linear-time-varying (LTV) model predictive control (MPC) is applied to ARS controller design with the consideration of multi-constraints. To evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the cooperative control framework, three maneuvers on the low adhesion road are conducted based on the co-simulation platform of CarSim and Simulink. Testing results indicate that the cooperative control framework can assist human driver to enhance vehicle's active safety. With the application of ARS control, the performance indexes of active safety are reduced more than 50%. In addition, it also shows that the ARS system has good adaptability and effectiveness to deal with different driving characteristics.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we develop a game theoretic model predictive controller (GTMPC) with aggressiveness estimation to deal with the mandatory lane change (MLC) problem in presence of several surrounding vehicles. GTMPC is responsible for driving a subject vehicle (SV) to a desired longitudinal position and executing lane-changing at the optimal moment. Specifically, GTMPC constantly establishes and solves Stackelberg games corresponding to multiple game candidate vehicles (GCV) within the game scope when SV is able to interact with GCVs by signaling a lane change intention through turn signal. GTMPC first selects one target vehicle (TV) within multiple GCVs based on the Stackelberg equilibrium, followed by estimating TV's aggressiveness based on the interaction between SV and TV, then completes the maneuver through MPC. GTMPC performance is compared with level-k game theoretic controller. Human-in-the-Loop results showed that GTMPC is capable to safely complete the MLC by properly assessing the aggressiveness of surrounding vehicles, driven either by intelligent driver model or human drivers.",

    "abstract": "Information obtainable from intelligent transportation systems (ITS) provides the possibility of improving safety and efficiency of vehicles at different levels. In particular, such information also has the potential to be utilized for the prediction of driving conditions and traffic flow, which allows Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) to run their powertrain components in corresponding optimum operating regions. This paper proposes to improve the performance of one of the most promising realtime powertrain control strategies, called adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (AECMS), using predicted driving conditions. In this paper, three real-time powertrain control strategies are proposed for HEVs, each of which introduces an adjustment factor for the cost of using electrical energy (equivalent factor) in AECMS. These factors are proportional to the predicted energy requirements of the vehicle, regenerative braking energy, and the cost of battery charging and discharging in a finite time window. Simulation results using detailed vehicle powertrain models illustrate that the proposed control strategies improve the performance of AECMS in terms of fuel economy, number of engine transients (ON/OFF), and charge sustainability of the battery.",

    "abstract": "In the presence of measurement noises and potential sensor malfunctioning, road condition identification by a single vehicle may not be reliable for motion planning and control of autonomous/intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we propose a distributed cooperative road condition estimation scheme for vehicular networks, involving a dynamic consensus algorithm to increase the reliability and accuracy of estimation. In this scheme, each vehicle individually estimates the road condition parameter using an online recursive least squares estimator, and disseminates it through the network to fuse the individual estimates through a consensus algorithm. It is shown that the proposed scheme well adapts to the variations in the road condition, improves the road condition estimation accuracy even with limited number of vehicles, and reduces the sensitivity to measurement noises. Simulation results demonstrate that estimation of the road condition using the proposed scheme improves the performance of maneuver planning for collision avoidance in slippery road conditions.",

    "abstract": "Even though some of the driver assistant systems have been commercialized to provide safety and convenience to the driver, they can be applied for autonomous driving in limited situations such as highways. In this paper, we propose a supervisor agent that can enhance the driver assistant systems by using deep distributional reinforcement learning. The supervisor agent is trained using end-to-end approach that directly maps both a camera image and LIDAR data into action plan. Because the well-trained network of deep reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected actions, collision avoidance function is added to prevent dangerous situations. In addition, the highway driving case is a stochastic environment with inherent randomness and, thus, its training is performed through the distributional reinforcement learning algorithm, which is specialized for stochastic environment. The optimal action for autonomous driving is selected through the return value distribution. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified through a highway driving simulator, which is implemented by the Unity ML-agents.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2020",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces an approach to produce accurate 3D detection boxes for objects on the ground using single monocular images. We do so by merging 2D visual cues, 3D object dimensions, and ground plane constraints to produce boxes that are robust against small errors and incorrect predictions. First, we train a single-shot convolutional neural network (CNN) that produces multiple visual and geometric cues of interest: 2D bounding boxes, 2D keypoints of interest, coarse object orientations and object dimensions. Subsets of these cues are then used to poll probable ground planes from a pre-computed database of ground planes, to identify the “best fit” plane with highest consensus. Once identified, the “best fit” plane provides enough constraints to successfully construct the desired 3D detection box, without directly predicting the 6DoF pose of the object. The entire ground plane polling (GPP) procedure is constructed as a non-parametrized layer of the CNN that outputs the desired “best fit” plane and the corresponding 3D keypoints, which together define the final 3D bounding box. Doing so allows us to poll thousands of different ground plane configurations without adding considerable overhead, while also creating a single CNN that directly produces the desired output without the need for post processing. We evaluate our method on the 2D detection and orientation estimation benchmark from the challenging KITTI dataset, and provide additional comparisons for 3D metrics of importance. This single-stage, single-pass CNN results in superior localization and orientation estimation compared to more complex and computationally expensive monocular approaches.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first of its kind real-time simulation of the effect of spray water on an automotive LIDAR sensor. The simulation is based on physically measurable quantities in order to facilitate its validation and extension. Both the sensor and the environment are simulated using open source software tools: Blender and Cycles, with the objective of facilitating standardization and broader adoption. The parameters required to construct and calibrate the simulation are extracted from real measurements done on a test area and highway covering different water film thicknesses and vehicle speeds. The simulation is validated in different stages, first by comparing the trajectories of the particles with a regular solver and secondly, by the spatial distribution of the virtual and real point clouds with the measurement results. The resulting framework can be easily expanded to cover scenarios that are more complex and other phenomena counterproductive to the performance of a LIDAR sensor like dirt, exhaust gases, snow, rain and fog. The virtually generated point clouds can be used to validate the performance of the software required for the segmentation, classification and tracking of objects generated by the LIDAR sensor, thereby reducing development costs and increasing software quality.",

    "abstract": "Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) have been developed and have subsequently decreased opportunities for driver skill development because of degraded situational awareness and less activity in the control loop. Beginning drivers must therefore engage in training. The idea has arisen that haptic shared control, which encourages a driver to operate the vehicle properly and with correct timing, should serve as a training system for daily driving. Such a system, however, might degrade performance, comfort, or safety because training aspects might increase the driver workload as a result of error correction feedback. The possibility of lowered usability is not acceptable for ADASs. This study was conducted to develop an assist system that achieves workload reduction and skill improvement. A haptic assistance system that applies guidance torque on the steering wheel was proposed and investigated for backward parking, which is a difficult driving situation. Driving simulator experiments were conducted. Results showed that both support and after-use effects were realized. This study provides knowledge for the development of driving systems using haptic assistant systems for which initial skill influences performance.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2022",
    "abstract": "Material transportation is an essential process in mining operations and accounts for a large portion of total energy consumption. With the development of automation technology, autonomous mining trucks have been deployed in open-pit mines to reduce transportation costs. Compared to manned mining trucks, autonomous trucks are more appropriate for automatic scheduling techniques due to their high informatization, high-precision perception, and sophisticated control. However, the existing truck scheduling research does not exploit autonomous trucks’ strengths to perform more delicate control, but still takes a traditional approach toward autonomous trucks. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer programming model for joint optimization of autonomous trucks trips and speeds to minimize energy consumption. To solve the proposed scheduling model, a novel tabu search algorithm is proposed, which consists of two parts: an improved flow allocation model with matching factor is formulated in the upper part to determine the optimal truck flow, and in the lower part a tabu search procedure guided with the optimal flow is developed. Based on the mathematical model and solution technique, we also propose a real-time scheduling system of autonomous trucks for the stochastic and dynamic mining environment. A coal mine in Inner Mongolia, China, for example, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed truck scheduling model and real-time scheduling approach. We demonstrate that the proposed allocation model effectively accelerates the tabu search procedure, and for short-term decisions, the proposed solution technique satisfies the computational requirements of the real-time scheduling system.",

    "abstract": "Lane change maneuver of high-speed automated vehicles is complicated, since it involves highly nonlinear vehicle dynamics, which is critical for the driving safety and handling stability. Addressing this challenge, we present the dynamic modeling and control of high-speed automated vehicles for lane change maneuver. A nonlinear single-track vehicle dynamics model and a multisegment lane change process model are employed. Variable time steps are utilized for the vehicle model discretization to ensure a long enough prediction horizon, while maintaining model fidelity and computational feasibility. Accordingly, the control of lane change maneuver is addressed in two successive stages. First, by considering the lane change maneuver as primarily a longitudinal control problem, velocity profiles are determined to ensure the longitudinal safety of this maneuver. Then, the associated lateral control is generated with a model-predictive controller, taking the handling stability envelope, coupled tire forces, and environmental constraints into account. Simulations demonstrate the real-time ability and stable-handling capability of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the design of a lateral control method for precision docking using GNSS/INS and LiDAR for localization. The aim of this study is to verify whether an automated driving bus can achieve the requirement of standard deviation of the lateral error (1.25 cm) using onboard sensors without additional infrastructure. To design the controller and decide the conditions of pilot tests on public roads, the vehicle dynamics, steering system, sensor dynamics, and disturbances are modelled. The steering system of the vehicle can be approximated as a second-order system, and the measuring time of the sensors are considered, which cause reduction of damping ratio in lateral dynamics. The numerical analysis revealed that the vehicle speed should be reduced to under 4.2 m/s (15 km/h) before precision docking starts, to make the lateral motion of the vehicle more stable. Experimental results show that the standard deviation of lateral error in precision docking using LiDAR for localization is 1.2 cm, which is slightly under the criterion threshold. The results also verify that the vehicle and sensor model describes the vehicle lateral motion appropriately.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an active fault tolerant control (FTC) scheme is proposed to achieve trajectory tracking of unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) subject to multiple uncertainties (external disturbances and modeling errors), actuator saturation and actuator fault. More challengingly, it is assumed that the linear and angular velocities are unavailable. The proposed scheme includes a fault detection (FD) unit, a fault isolation (FI) unit and an FTC unit. The FD is performed by an adaptive interval observer (IO), where adaptive parameters instead of uncertainty bounds are used. The adaptive parameters change automatically until the interval widths between outputs and their upper/lower bounds reach a given range which is independent of uncertainty bounds. Hence the proposed FD scheme not only provides tighter upper and lower bound estimates of states, but also is more sensitive to faults. The FI unit which consists of a set of IOs determines the location of actuator fault. The FTC unit is developed to guarantee that the tracking errors satisfy the desired transient performance, where the unmeasurable states are expressed as a linear combination of their upper and lower bounds, provided by the FD and FI observers, and no additional state observers are needed to estimate unmeasurable states. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Big data has shown its uniquely powerful ability to reveal, model, and understand driver behaviors. The amount of data affects the experiment cost and conclusions in the analysis. Insufficient data may lead to inaccurate models, whereas excessive data lead to waste resources. For projects that cost millions of dollars, it is critical to determine the right amount of data needed. However, how to decide the appropriate amount has not been fully studied in the realm of driver behaviors. This paper systematically investigates this issue to estimate how much naturalistic driving data (NDD) is needed for understanding driver behaviors from a statistical point of view. A general assessment method is proposed using a Gaussian kernel density estimation to catch the underlying characteristics of driver behaviors. We then apply the Kullback-Leibler divergence method to measure the similarity between density functions with differing amounts of NDD. A max-minimum approach is used to compute the appropriate amount of NDD. To validate our proposed method, we investigated the car-following case using NDD collected from the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment program. We demonstrate that from a statistical perspective, the proposed approach can provide an appropriate amount of NDD capable of capturing most features of the normal car-following behavior, which is consistent with the experiment settings in many literatures.",

    "abstract": "In the modern challenging urban environment, powered two wheelers (PTW) are selected for their everyday commuting. The way motorcycles and scooters travel through traffic is systematically emphasized in the recent relevant literature as being complex, especially in relation to overtaking. In this paper, meta-optimized Decision Trees, a special case of machine learning (ML) models, are developed in order to model the unconventional overtaking patterns of PTW drivers. Based on detailed naturalistic trajectory data collected using video footage from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in a three-lane arterial in Athens, Greece, two different models of PTW driving behavior are developed. The first model addresses the decision of the PTW driver to overtake or not the preceding vehicle. The second model focuses on PTW driver's intention to overtake or undertake (pass from the right) it. The developed decision tree models are further analyzed in relation to the revealed significant factors during overtaking. Following, the applicability of the developed algorithms in the context of intelligent transportation systems and connected vehicles is discussed, which reveals the importance of acquiring quality data using advanced equipment combined with advanced ML approaches for advanced modeling methods.",

    "abstract": "Effective simulation and testing environment is a vital part in the research of self-driving vehicles. It is capable of testing self-driving software and hardware quickly in a variety of virtual environments at low cost. However, as for the current mainstream simulation platforms, a considerable gap exists between the constructed virtual environment and the actual self-driving platform, which decreases the efficiency of development and makes it difficult to complete the migration from the virtual scenario to the real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation system. It takes the real hardware electronic control unit (ECU) of the self-driving vehicle as a part of the simulation platform, which improves the efficiency of development and testing, and also, the verified algorithms can be implemented into self-driving cars faster than ever before. The proposed HiL simulation system mainly consists of four parts: the vehicle kinematic model simulation, the multi-sensor simulation, the environment simulation, and the ECU hardware. Simulation experiments on applying the HiL system are used to verify the validity of self-driving algorithms in virtual scenes, including perception, planning, decision making, and control. Furthermore, algorithms that are tested in the simulation environment can be rapidly deployed into the real self-driving vehicles. In this paper, we also presented the verification processes of various algorithms, such as planning and control. These algorithms are implemented in the HiL system, and the experimental results show the validity of our proposed platform.",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian behavior prediction is essential to enable safe and efficient driving of intelligent vehicles on urban traffic environment. This article presents a novel framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction, which integrates Dynamic Bayesian network and Sequence-to-Sequence model through an adaptive online weighting method. Dynamic Bayesian network utilizes environmental features and kinematic information to infer the pedestrian's motion intentions through probabilistic reasoning. Sequence-to-Sequence model views trajectory predictions as sequence generation tasks, in which the future trajectories are generated relying on the observed trajectories. A real-world pedestrian motion dataset is employed for model validations and it is also enlarged through data augmentation techniques to enable training of data-driven approaches. We compare our model with several typical baselines methods and results show that our model outperforms those baselines. The average error and the final destination error with one-second prediction are 0.04m and 0.10m in crossing scenarios, and 0.06m and 0.17m in stopping scenarios, respectively. The study expects to provide guidelines for the decision-making of intelligent vehicles in order to protect vulnerable road users.",

    "abstract": "This article is motivated by the lack of empirical data on the performance of commercially available Society of Automotive Engineers level one automated driving systems. To address this, a set of car following experiments are conducted to collect data from a 2015 luxury electric vehicle equipped with a commercial adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. Velocity, relative velocity, and spacing data collected during the experiments are used to calibrate an optimal velocity relative velocity car following model for both the minimum and maximum following settings. The string stability of both calibrated models is assessed, and it is determined that the best-fit models are string unstable, indicating they are not able to prevent all traffic disturbances from amplifying into phantom jams. Based on the calibrated models, we identify the consequences of the string unstable ACC system on synthetic and empirical lead vehicle disturbances, highlighting that commercial ACC platoons of moderate size can dampen some disturbances even while being string unstable. The primary contributions of this article are the development of a data-driven approach to calculate string stability of ACC systems, and the collection and interpretation of a dataset to understand the car following behavior of a commercial ACC system.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2018",
    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the multi-vehicle motion planning (MVMP) problem for cooperative lane changes of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The predominant decentralized MVMP methods can hardly explore and utilize the cooperation capability of a multi-vehicle team, thus they usually lead to low-quality solutions. This paper proposes a two-stage MVMP framework to find high-quality online solutions. Concretely, at stage 1, the CAV platoon transfers from its original formation to a sufficiently sparse formation; at stage 2, all the CAVs simultaneously change lanes with collision avoidance implicitly ensured. The CAVs only involve longitudinal rather than lateral motions at stage 1, thus the collision-avoidance constraints can be easily handled. Since stage 2 begins with a sparse formation, the implicitly ensured collision avoidance can be completely omitted then. Through this, the proposed method avoids directly handling the challenging collision avoidance conditions, thereby being able to compute fast. As the vehicles run cooperatively and simultaneously at either stage, the obtained solutions are near-optimal. The completeness, effectiveness, and quality of the proposed two-stage MVMP method are validated through theoretical analysis and comparative simulations.",

Deployment of upcoming technologies based on cooperative systems will likely be the key step toward a significant reduction of accidents across the globe. Particularly in the case of conveying information to the driver in the form of dynamic warnings based on V2X communication technologies representing different levels of danger, it is crucial to investigate driver distraction levels, as well as the modality and dimension of the visual warnings and their appropriate in-vehicle location. This paper summarizes and analyzes previously published works in the field of human–machine interaction for use in a vehicular context, in particular those which address messages conveyed by cooperative systems, providing the designer and the general audience with a background, variety of approaches, and example applications of the most current and important concepts in the field.",

    "publication_date": "March 2022",
    "abstract": "The vehicle motion signals is not able to be replicated using the simulation-based motion platform (SBMP) because of the workspace boundaries. The workspace limitations are determined based on the displacement, velocity and acceleration limitations of the actuators. The motion cueing algorithms (MCAs) are introduced to reproduce the motion sensation for the driver of the SBMP same as the real vehicle's driver while keeping the SBMP inside the actuators' limitations. The optimal MCA was developed to decrease the human motion sensation error between the real vehicle's driver and the SBMP's user based on the human vestibular system model using the linear quadratic regulator method. However, the inverse acceleration kinematics model of the SBMPs are not considered in developing optimal MCA to control the displacement, velocity and acceleration of actuators. The lack of inverse acceleration kinematics consideration inside the optimal MCA causes the poor consumption of the SBMP's workspace, as the optimal MCA only considers the boundaries of the SBMP in the Cartesian coordinate system. In this paper, the new optimal MCA based on the inverse acceleration kinematic solution of the SBMP is designed and developed to regenerate the more realistic motion sensation. The validation of the new optimal MCA is performed using Simulink/MATLAB. The outcomes demonstrate that using the new optimal MCA will reach a better motion sensation with less false motion signals in contrast with the existing optimal MCAs.",

    "abstract": "Verification and validation (V&V) hold a significant position in the research and development of automated vehicles (AVs). Current literature indicates that different V&V techniques have been implemented in the decision-making and planning (DMP) system to improve AVs' safety, comfort, and energy optimization. This paper aims to review a range of different V&V approaches for the DMP system of AVs and divides these approaches into three distinct categories: scenario-based testing, fault injection testing, and formal verification. Further, scenario-based testing is categorized into fundamental and advanced approaches based on the interaction between road users in generated scenarios. In this paper, six criteria are proposed to compare and evaluate the characteristics of V&V approaches, which could help researchers gain insight into the benefits and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assist with approach choices. Next, the DMP system is broken down into a hierarchy of modules, and the functional requirements of each module are deduced. The suitable approaches are matched to verify and validate each module aiming at their different functional requirements. Finally, the current challenges and future research directions are concluded.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2021",
    "abstract": "Object detectors are central to autonomous driving and are widely used in driver assistance systems. Object detectors are trained on a finite amount of data within a specific domain, hampering detection performance when applying object detectors to samples from other domains during inference, an effect known as domain gap. Domain gap is a concern for data-driven applications, evoking repetitive retraining of networks when the applications unfold into other domains. With object detectors that have been trained on day images only, a domain gap can be observed in object detection by night. Training object detectors on night images is critical because of the enormous effort required to generate an adequate amount of diversely labeled data, and existing data sets often tend to overfit specific domain characteristics. For the first time, this work proposes adapting domains by online image-to-image translation to expand an object detector's domain of operation. The domain gap is decreased without additional labeling effort and without having to retrain the object detector while unfolding into the target domain. The approach follows the concept of domain adaptation, shifting the target domain samples into the domain knownto the object detector (source domain). Firstly, the UNIT network is trained for domain adaptation and subsequently cast into an online domain adaptation module, which narrows down the domain gap. Domain adaptation capabilities are evaluated qualitatively by displaying translated samples and visualizing the domain shift through the 2D tSNE algorithm. We quantitatively benchmark the domain adaptation's influence on a state-of-the-art object detector, and on a retrained object detector, for mean average precision, mean recall, and the resulting F1-score. Our approach achieves an F1 score improvement of 5.27 % within object detection by night when applying online domain adaptation. The evaluation is executed on the BDD100K benchmark data set.",

The primary goal is to jointly minimize the access time of the emergency services and to accurately store the event dynamics for further investigation on accident's responsibilities. For motorcycles, unlike for cars, crash events cannot always be detected by monitoring abnormal longitudinal decelerations solely. Thus, this work proposes a novel method that detects and classifies the severity of crash-like situations. The proposed approach follows a new paradigm that improves the detection performance, better generalizing the motorcycle dynamics with respect to the specific vehicle and the driving style. The proposed approach has been tested and validated with experimental data, covering both motorsport and naturalistic scenarions, involving several riders, different road conditions and vehicles.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an intelligent energy management strategy for a hybrid hydraulic-electric vehicle in order to minimize its total energy consumption. It proposes first to model the vehicle total energy consumption and investigates the minimization of an expended energy function, formulated as the sum of electrical energy provided by the on-board batteries and consumed fuel. More precisely, it is proposed in this paper an intelligent controller that shows its capabilities of increasing the overall vehicle energy efficiency and, therefore, minimizing total energy consumption. The proposed strategy consists of an advanced supervisory controller at the highest level (third), which corresponds to a fuzzy system deciding the most appropriate operating mode of the system. In the second level, an intelligent optimal control strategy is developed based on neuro-fuzzy logic. Then, in the first level, there are local fuzzy controllers to regulate vehicle subsystems set points to reach the best operational performance. The advantage of the proposed strategy could be summarized as follows: first, it can be implemented online and second, reduces total energy consumption compared with several traditional methods. The proposed strategy validations are performed using a mix of automotive TruckMaker and MATLAB/Simulink developed software on several (standard or not) driving cycles.",

    "publication_date": "March 2019",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the possibility of estimating the actual pose of a passenger car while parking by adaptive multisensor data fusion. The newly developed Odometry 2.0 estimator includes multiple dead-reckoning models implemented by the adaptive measurement model of an Extended Information filter. The measurements of orientation and velocity of each of the four wheels, corrected kinematic side-slip angles and the yaw rate serve as input for the estimator. The chosen architecture allows the measurements to be combined individually. This makes it possible to deal with systematic errors in modeling, depending on the quality of the measurements, by changing the composition of the measurement model. In addition, a Slip Detection Algorithm (SDA) is implemented, which sets the information measurement covariance of the slipping wheel measurement to 0, so that the inaccurate measurement cannot influence the estimated pose. Separate modeling of translation and rotation allows to estimate the vehicle's position from the information of a single wheel, making it a true four-wheel-odometry model. Experimental results confirm the excellent performance of the Odometry 2.0 estimator in contrast to the well-known state-of-the-art dead-rocking models for parking, analyzed by position data obtained from a Dual-DGNSS-IMU reference system. The SDA was tested under real conditions on partially snow-covered areas.",

    "abstract": "Intelligence in vehicles has developed through the years as self-driving expectations and capabilities have increased. To date, the majority of the literature has focused on longitudinal control topics (e.g. Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Cooperative ACC (CACC), etc.). To a lesser extent, there have been a variety of research articles specifically dealing with lateral control, e.g., maneuvers such as lane changes and merging. This paper provides a survey of this particular area of vehicle automation. The key topics addressed are control systems, positioning systems, communication systems, simulation modeling, field tests, surroundings vehicles, and human factors. Overall, there has been some successful research and field testing in lane change and merge maneuvers; however, there is a strong need for standardization and even more research to enable comprehensive field testing of these lateral maneuvers, so that commercial implementation of automated vehicles can be realized.",

    "publication_date": "June 2017",
    "abstract": "Combining a high-power source like a supercapacitor with a lithium-ion battery for electric vehicle applications results in performance improvements, high efficiency, long lifetime, lightweight design, and relatively modest cost of the overall source. A hybrid energy storage system controlled by a smart energy management strategy can play a key role in the design and development of multisource electric vehicles. In this study, an optimal energy management strategy based on particle swarm optimization incorporating the Nelder-Mead simplex method is proposed. The goal of the proposed strategy is to minimize the battery power stress and improve its lifetime. This is achieved by coupling a rule-based method based on the knowledge of the battery and supercapacitor efficiency operating with a hybrid Particle Swarm-Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. This latter approach is proposed to optimize the control parameters of the rule-based energy management strategy. Once the offline optimization algorithm is completed, the control method can be implemented online. The developed strategy is tested in a simulation environment and in an experimental platform using a power emulator test bench of a lithium-ion battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system. The results, in terms of battery power stress and lifetime, are compared with a conventional rule-based method and a monosource with a single high-power lithium-ion battery. Obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy allowing the satisfaction of the requested performance with better battery usage. The evaluation results also demonstrate significant lifetime enhancements for the Li-ion battery, an increase of up to 20% as compared to the monosource based on a regular single battery.",

    "abstract": "High electric vehicles (EVs) penetration is expected to increase smart grid solicitation especially with various EV charging demands. As result, the EV charging process at the supply station has to be managed in the way to promote the EV satisfaction level while preserving smart grid stability. In this article, the bidirectional power flow between EV and grid; Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), is exploited. We make a profit from the unused electric power of EVs and we present an EV load management technique based on EV charging and EV discharging coordination. We propose a peak load management model (PLM) used to schedule EVs for charging or discharging service according to the power demand with the timing and location where each EV need to be served. Also, we propose an Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) selection model to guide EVs to the supply station. We develop a mathematical formalism for handling requests for EV charging/discharging at EVSE based on queuing theory. Those models are evaluated while considering the mobility of vehicles in an urban scenario and time-of-use-pricing (TOUP). Finally, extensive matlab simulations are conducted to validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its effectiveness.",

RADAR measurements provide unique capabilities for ego-motion estimation while also posing unique challenges. This paper presents the novel real-time RADAR-based ego-motion estimation algorithm, RADARODO (RADAR Odometry). RADARODO is differentiated from similar techniques by two novel attributes. First, it decouples sensor translational and rotational motion by estimating them from Doppler and spatial data, respectively. Secondly, it directly analyzes RADAR images to estimate rotational motion via correspondence-free non-linear optimization. Unlike other methods, RADARODO estimates ego-motion along with its predicted uncertainty from a single RADAR sensor without depending on a lever-arm offset or the zero side-slip assumption. The real-world results demonstrate accurate ego-motion estimates that are particularly suited for integration within a “tightly-coupled” sensor fusion framework.",

    "abstract": "Human drivers navigate the roadways by balancing values such as safety, legality, and mobility. An automated vehicle driving on the same roadways as humans likely needs to navigate based on similar values. The iterative methodology of value sensitive design (VSD) is used to formalize the connection of human values to engineering specifications. A modified VSD methodology is used to develop an automated vehicle speed control algorithm to safely navigate a pedestrian crosswalk. Two VSD iterations are presented that model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and use dynamic programming to compute an optimal policy to control the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle based on the belief of whether a pedestrian is crossing. The speed control algorithms were tested in real time on an experimental vehicle on a closed-road course.",

    "abstract": "Automotive radar and vehicular communication are the two primary means of establishing an intelligent transportation system. However, both the systems are susceptible to interference. The inter-vehicular interference significantly affects the radar and communication performance, especially in the dense traffic scenarios. In this work, we have shown that lowering down radar range in dense traffic scenario provides twofold advantages; (a) it reduces radar-to-radar interference and, (b) it provides resources to support the vehicular communication. We propose a joint Radar-Communication (R-Comm) algorithm which enables connected vehicles to use a fraction of radar resources for vehicular communication based on the traffic density. Also, two different schemes have been proposed for R-Comm transmission in the sparse and dense traffic scenarios. Further, through simulation results, it is shown that R-Comm benefits both radar and communication systems.",

    "abstract": "Recently proposed adaptive platooning strategies for connected automated vehicles are able to address uncertain parameters of the vehicles in the platoon (uncertain driveline time constants), but are limited to acyclic interaction like look-ahead interaction. This restrains from augmenting platooning protocols with synchronized merging maneuvers, where cyclic communication is needed and creates algebraic loops that require well posedness of the inputs. We propose an adaptive protocol for synchronized merging in the cyclic communication scenario. The protocol exploits a set of adaptive control strategies, designed to cope with uncertain driveline time constants. Well-posedness of the control inputs is proven in a distributed way (using information from neighboring vehicles) in spite of uncertainty and cyclic communication. The proposed strategy is shown in a benchmark merging scenario.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2022",
    "abstract": "Distraction, misjudgement and driving mistakes can significantly affect a driver, resulting in an increased risk of accidents. There are diverse factors that can cause mistakes in driving such as unfamiliarity with the road, situation unawareness, fatigue, stress, and drowsiness. In emerging smart cars, sensing, actuation, advanced signal processing and machine learning are deployed to reduce the impact of driving errors by monitoring the state of the driver in real-time, detecting the mistakes, and deploying necessary actions to counteract them. Such strategies are collectively known as human-machine shared driving. Towards a better understanding of the developments taken place in this domain, as well as identifying gaps and trends in this discipline, a systematic review of the major studies and developments reported in the literature is conducted. The study is based on 155 papers of human-machine shared driving, selected through a thorough and comprehensive search of the literature. The review demonstrates that shared control approaches are mostly dependent on vehicle and environmental data obtained through various sensors. The majority of methods deploy active shared control by leveraging longitudinal and lateral dynamics. However, the precise recognition of driver’s intent and actions, accurate estimation of situation awareness, and modelling the trust between driver and automation are still major challenges preventing timely transition of control from the driver to machine or vice-versa, and resulting in fatal accidents. Major challenges in human-machine shared driving are identified and potential future directions of the work are explored.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring a safe mobility for elderly drivers is one of the important issues to be addressed for supporting the daily life of elderly. Shared control of a risk predictive braking maneuver attempts to manage the potential risk of crashing with respect to hazards that cannot be seen by the driver. The assistance system performs a partial deceleration maneuver to achieve a referenced velocity in uncertain situations, such as one in which an unobserved pedestrian might initiate a road crossing. This paper presents the following: first, an analysis of hazard-anticipatory driving for an expert driver; second, a detailed description of risk predictive control; third, the effectiveness and limitations of risk predictive control obtained through a numerical simulation; fourth, the framework of the driver assistance system; and fifth, experimental data for evaluation of proactive safety performance. Specifically, three questions will be investigated: How would expert drivers drive in uncertain situations?; How can a reference velocity be determined?; and How can a system be designed so that the relationship between the human and the machine is complementary? Based on this framework, this paper discusses a shared control system that dynamically shares control authority between the elderly driver and the ADAS.",

    "publication_date": "March 2021",
    "abstract": "The deep learning object detection algorithms have become one of the powerful tools for road vehicle detection in autonomous driving. However, the limitation of the number of high-quality labeled training samples makes the single-object detection algorithms unable to achieve satisfactory accuracy in road vehicle detection. In this paper, by comparing the pros and cons of various object detection algorithms, two different algorithms with a different emphasis are selected for a weighted ensemble. Besides, a new ensemble method named the Soft-Weighted-Average method is proposed. The proposed method is attenuated by the confidence, and it “punishes” the detection result of the corresponding relationship by the confidence attenuation, instead of by deleting the output of a certain model. The proposed method can further reduce the vehicle misdetection of the target detection algorithm, obtaining a better detection result. Lastly, the ensemble method can achieve an average accuracy of 94.75% for simple targets, which makes it the third-ranked method in the KITTI evaluation system.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a resource-efficient communication mechanism is investigated for the cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) of vehicles subject to actuator delay and disturbances. Specifically, a dynamic event-triggered communication mechanism (DECM) is designed for a tracking error (spacing error, velocity error, and acceleration error) based sampled-data feedback controller. Under the DECM, the transmissions of sampled velocity and acceleration from a preceding vehicle to the controller can be significantly reduced. Sufficient conditions for the stability of the CACC system are obtained for the DECM-based sampled-data feedback controller. According to the obtained conditions, parameter design criteria are established for the DECM to guarantee the stable performance of CACC systems. Simulation studies illustrate that the proposed DECM-based CACC system can not only save inter-vehicle communication resources, but also guarantee stable performance.",

Although many competitions have been launched for autonomous driving, most of them focused on on-road driving scenarios.

In addition, previous competitions typically competed on the overall driving performance instead of the trajectory planning performance. A trajectory planning competition of automated parking (TPCAP) has been recently organized. This event competed on parking-oriented planners without involving other modules, such as localization, perception, or tracking control.

    "abstract": "Predictive control is a popular approach for further improving the efficiency and performance of vehicular systems enabling intelligent systems behavior appropriate to the driving situation. To calculate such control strategies, the future vehicle dynamics or subsequent states have to be predicted. We introduce a stochastic framework based on an explanatory model and stochastic processes to predict future vehicle dynamics with road network data. The distributions of the future states are approximated using sequential Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed approach enables stochastic forecasts incorporating uncertain driver behavior and available road data. Parameter inference is shown for exemplary real-drive test data, and predictive performance is evaluated using commonly used reference models. The results show that the explanatory model provides more specific information than time-series models do, still considering the uncertainty in the driver's behavior or the situation. The framework can be applied with predictive control algorithms enabling intelligent control of vehicular systems. Furthermore, the framework or parts of it may be usable for other applications like predicting behavior of traffic participants or general characterization of driver behavior.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a multiple-object vehicle tracking system. We introduce a method to combine bounding boxes extracted from multiple CNNs-based detections as alight and accurate alternative to confidence-based detection methods such as non-maximum suppression and clustering approaches predicting a single bounding box. An intersection over union metric and a threshold value is proposed to determine whether a single detection or a connectivity graph between extracted bounding boxes exists. Affinity measurements are extracted from features representing bounding box geometry, appearance comparison, and changing scene properties. Then, data association is performed by solving the min-cost flow problem of the temporal windows' affinity network. An affinity network of a directed graph associates the objects and determines whether an existing tracklet is maintained, terminated, or a new tracklet is initiated. Our model is evaluated and tested by KITTI object tracking-Car class benchmark dataset. Overall, the proposed multiple object tracking performance is ranked second according to the multiple object tracking accuracy, mostly tracked, mostly lost statistical metric values assure lower fragmentation and less than half of the captured ID-switch in comparison with respect to the method reaching at the highest multiple object tracking accuracy metric. Furthermore, the runtime is six times faster.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and predicting human-driven vehicle behaviors are critically important for the planning and control of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic which includes both autonomous and human-driven vehicles. Despite the tremendous efforts on this problem, the traditional general driver model-based approaches are subject to prediction accuracy issues and the state-of-the-art data-driven heuristic approaches are subject to scalability issues. To this end, this paper proposes a novel inverse model predictive control (IMPC) based approach to address these issues. The approach can learn the internal control process of human drivers through the automatic learning of their cost functions in a novel IMPC setup, which could result in improvements in both the accuracy and scalability. The approach was implemented and validated with realistic human driver studies. The experiments illustrated that the proposed approach could achieve a better accuracy and a better scalability for unseen scenarios compared to existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Classification and analysis of driving behaviors offer in-depth knowledge to make an efficient decision for autonomous vehicles. This paper aims to cluster a wide range of driving encounter scenarios based only on multi-vehicle GPS trajectories. Towards this end, we propose a generic unsupervised learning framework comprising of two layers: feature representation layer and clustering layer. In the feature representation layer, we combine the deep autoencoders with a distance-based measure to map the sequential observations of driving encounters into a computationally tractable space, which quantifies the spatiotemporal interaction characteristics of two vehicles. The clustering algorithm is then applied to the extracted representations to cluster homogeneous driving encounters into groups. Our proposed generic framework is then evaluated using 2,568 naturalistic driving encounters. Experimental results show that our proposed generic framework incorporated with unsupervised learning can cluster multi-trajectory data into distinct groups. These clustering results could benefit the decision-making and design of autonomous vehicles.",

Intelligent tires equipped with in-tire sensors have been proposed to recognize the tire-road interaction conditions, such as road surface conditions, tire dynamics states, and friction conditions, which can help realize safer driving of autonomous vehicles. In this study, we first review the related research of intelligent tires about the sensing system and tire-road contact state estimation methods and discuss their desirability and limitations. On this basis, we propose our constructive strategies for improving the design of the intelligent tire sensing system to adapt to the extremely harsh working condition of tires, make full use of the installed sensors, and realize the continuous measurement of tire-road contact information. In addition, we analyze the specific requirements for the implementation process when applying intelligent tires to autonomous driving. In the future, intelligent tires with specially designed sensing systems combined with optimal recognition methods can bring new opportunities to safer vehicle dynamics control and promote the development of autonomous driving technology.",

    "abstract": "Semantic outdoor scene understanding based on 3D LiDAR point clouds is a challenging task for autonomous driving due to the sparse and irregular data structure. This paper takes advantages of the uneven range distribution of different LiDAR laser beams to propose a range aware instance segmentation network, RangeSeg. RangeSeg uses a shared encoder backbone with two range dependent decoders. A heavy decoder only computes top of a range image where the far and small objects locate to improve small object detection accuracy, and a light decoder computes whole range image for low computational cost. The results are further clustered by the DBSCAN method with a resolution weighted distance function to get instance-level segmentation results. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that RangeSeg outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods with enormous speedup and improves the instance-level segmentation performance on small and far objects. The whole RangeSeg pipeline meets the real time requirement on NVIDIA JETSON AGX Xavier with 19 frames per second in average.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2017.2691158",
    "publication_date": "Dec. 2016",
    "abstract": "An exploratory study in a moving-base simulator with 34 volunteers examined the effects of automated driving system reduced-confidence notifications on driver response. Reduced confidence in this context is defined as a system performance level that is lower than optimal, yet not so low as to disable the system. The threshold for such a level is essentially a policy decision based on perceived costs and benefits of keeping the automation engaged versus disengaging it. So, a reduced-confidence notification was designed to simply indicate that the driver should be especially vigilant to the increased potential to have to take manual control of the vehicle. An actual manual takeover request from the automated system would require the driver to take manual control of the vehicle. To investigate this, a 32-min highway driving scenario was constructed for this exploratory investigation that included 16 potential loss-of-lane tracking segments within this time frame. Three factors at two levels (low/high) each were crossed and presented in a between-subjects experimental design. One factor was system confidence/competence match, which refers to the ratio of the number of actual automation system failures over the number of reduced-confidence notifications. A second factor was the consequence of automation failure, i.e., drifting toward a busy traffic lane or drifting toward a wide shoulder. The third factor was detectability, or being able to see versus not see why the automated driving system began to drift out-of-lane. Data analyses indicated that automated driving with reduced-confidence notifications was judged to be both useful and acceptable regardless of the manipulated factors. However, the lowest incidence of preemption (i.e., manual takeovers prior to the start of a lane drift) was associated with low automation competence/confidence match and low detectability, regardless of consequences. It was also associated with responding later by some drivers. On the other hand, when the reduced-confidence notifications were perfectly matched with the need to manually takeover, there were fewer instances of delayed driver responses. Results are discussed in terms of “cry wolf” effects.",

In this paper, we propose a continuous-time route reservation architecture to efficiently manage vehicle routing decisions thus to eliminate congested conditions. The related problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programme (MILP) that routes vehicles while avoiding road segments that reach their critical density. To reduce the high computational complexity of the MILP approach, we develop a heuristic algorithm, which is shown to perform well compared to the MILP formulation. The heuristic algorithm is used to conduct extensive microsimulations across a real network topology of the San Francisco area. Finally, an extension of the proposed architecture is also developed, where the modeling uncertainties are considered through a time-varying regression method making able in real-time accurate travel-time predictions minimizing the reservation errors.",

    "abstract": "Automated vehicles require efficient and safe planning to maneuver in uncertain environments. Largely this uncertainty is caused by other traffic participants, e.g., surrounding vehicles. Future motion of surrounding vehicles is often difficult to predict. Whereas robust control approaches achieve safe, yet conservative motion planning for automated vehicles, Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) provides efficient planning in the presence of uncertainty. Probabilistic constraints are applied to ensure that the maximal risk remains below a predefined level. However, safety cannot be ensured as probabilistic constraints may be violated, which is not acceptable for automated vehicles. Here, we propose an efficient trajectory planning framework with safety guarantees for automated vehicles. SMPC is applied to obtain efficient vehicle trajectories for a finite horizon. Based on the first optimized SMPC input, a guaranteed safe backup trajectory is planned using reachable sets. This backup is used to overwrite the SMPC input if necessary for safety. Recursive feasibility of the safe SMPC algorithm is proved. Highway simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method regarding performance and safety.",

    "abstract": "Road detection is an important task in autonomous navigation systems. In this paper, we propose a road detection framework induced by the inverse depth of LiDAR's point cloud. This framework is a fusion of a 3-D LiDAR and a monocular camera, where the 3-D point cloud of LiDAR is projected onto the camera's image frame, to exploit both range and color information. For the same road detection task, we propose an inverse-depth aware fully convolutional neural network based on image information and a line scanning strategy based on an inverse-depth histogram of LiDAR's point cloud. Finally, a conditional random field fusion method integrates the two road detection results. Our method is evaluated on KITTI-Road benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in road detection among all the referable methods that have ever reported their results on the KITTI-Road benchmark.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2020.2987437",
    "publication_date": "March 2021",
    "abstract": "Many achievements concerning developments in the field of automated driving have been made. However, automated driving still faces the challenge of safety validation. Conventional methods are not suitable any more for this highly complex automation system. Therefore, the method named Virtual Assessment of Automation in Field Operation (VAAFO) is motivated. In this approach, automated driving system has no access to actuators but rather runs parallel to the human driver. Consequently, this approach is divided into two modules: online trajectory comparison and offline safety assessment. This paper focuses on the second module, in which uncertainties in world model are reduced and then the safety of Automated Vehicle (AV) is evaluated. Retrospective post-processing combined with Joint Integrated Probabilistic Data Association (JIPDA) tracker is put forward to reduce existence uncertainties. State uncertainties are reduced by an Unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother (URTSS). Furthermore, inverse TTC and remaining lateral distance are utilized to assess the safety of AV in the corrected world model. The results demonstrate that retrospective post-processing combined with JIPDA can reduce existence uncertainties greatly. URTSS is very useful for reducing state uncertainties. The studied case illustrates that the safety of AV can be assessed by parallel running and critical scenarios are found accordingly.",

    "publication_date": "June 2017",
    "abstract": "Pedestrian protection systems (PPSs) are crucial for reducing road traffic fatalities. However, the relatively high cost of today's PPSs prevents the majority of economy cars from receiving their benefits. In this paper, we propose an effective and low-cost sparse feature interaction descriptor (SpaFIND) that is designed for real-time pedestrian detection with limited computational power in economy cars. SpaFIND extends the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature and selectively computes the pairwise relationships between neighboring components of the HOG. Therefore, SpaFIND can capture the second-order properties of object appearance while maintaining a low computational load, which is the main contribution of this paper. During the experiments, we performed comparative evaluations of the proposed system against several baseline methods on the Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark in terms of detection accuracy and computational load. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed low-cost SpaFIND feature, which can meet the requirements for implementing a PPS with limited computational power, thereby contributing to the massive deployment of PPSs in economy cars in the immediate future.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2021",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a progressive model predictive control scheme (PMPCS) by considering the cooperative control of local planning and path tracking for intelligent vehicles. An improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) based model predictive control (MPC) method is developed to solve the planning and tracking problem. With the PMPCS, the total computational burden can be reduced sharply because of the seamless connection and mutual promotion between the optimization of two layers. Besides we also propose a novel planning algorithm, which can take traffic lights and overtaking time constraint into account. To solve these problems, we first combine model predictive control with artificial potential field (APF) to get a collision-free path by treating the time-varying safety constraints as the scope of the repulsive force and an asymmetrical lane potential field function. Furthermore, the pseudo velocity planning method is adopted to take traffic lights into account in the planning module. Simulation results show the reliability of the proposed algorithm and the advantages of the scheme compared with general hierarchical algorithm.",

    "abstract": "To guide an automated vehicle safely through complex traffic, knowledge about the future evolution of the driving situation has to be considered. The contribution at hand proposes an approach for automated driving in structured environments. An environment representation for trajectory planning is presented that enables predictive driving by interconnecting trajectory prediction for the surrounding traffic and planning of an according ego trajectory. A maneuver-based approach with an efficient trajectory model is carried out to enable an accurate and fast estimation of future motions of other vehicles. The results are directly considered in the dynamic environment representation utilized for trajectory planning. In the trajectory optimization process, the required safety distance is hence taken into account uniquely for each future time instance. The evaluation of the trajectory prediction approach shows very good performance on a simulated as well as on a dataset recorded by a test vehicle. On account of the predictive character of the developed environment potential field, simulation experiments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The fusion of multi-modal information can enhance task accuracy but indiscriminate sensing and fusion in all modalities increase demand on available system resources. This paper presents a task-driven approach to input fusion that minimizes the utilization of resource-heavy sensors and demonstrates its application to Visual-Lidar fusion for object tracking and path planning. The proposed spatiotemporal sampling algorithm activates Lidar only at regions-of-interest identified by analyzing visual input and reduces the Lidar ‘base frame rate’ according to the kinematic state of the system. This significantly reduces Lidar usage, in terms of data sensed/transferred and potentially power consumed, without a severe reduction in performance compared to both a baseline decision-level fusion and state-of-the-art deep multi-modal fusion.",

    "abstract": "Range anxiety has remained a critical technological bottleneck in electric vehicles (EVs). The issue lies in the fact that the estimation of the EV's batteries state of charge (SoC) is still inaccurate and unreliable due to the complex and nonlinear characteristics of the batteries. To tackle the problem, this paper presents a novel real-time mixed SoC estimation algorithm for the EV's lithium-ion batteries for implementation in an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). The mixed estimation algorithm combines: i) an improved Coulomb counting method (CCM) that takes into account the battery state-of-health, operating temperature, and aging effect, ii) a model-based method (MBM) that represents a real-time recursive structure of the battery, and iii) a bottom-up based method (BUBM) that takes into account a variety of the environmental conditions, traffic conditions, auxiliary loads, and driver's behavior. To validate the proposed algorithm, several laboratory tests under real-time driving cycles have been conducted on a Manganese-oxide Li-ion cell of a 2012 Nissan Leaf battery cell. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model has been demonstrated by driving the Nissan Leaf along a selected route in Australia. The results demonstrate a great accuracy for the SoC estimation compared to previous models.",

    "abstract": "Vision-based driver assistance systems involve a range of data-intensive operations, which pose challenges in implementing them as robust and real-time systems on resource constrained embedded computing platforms. In order to achieve both high accuracy and real-time performance, the constituent algorithms need to be designed and optimized such that they lend well for embedded realization. In this paper, we present a novel two-camera-based embedded driver assistance framework that analyzes the dynamics of vehicles in the front and rear surround views of the host vehicle (ego-vehicle). In order to do this, we propose a set of integrated techniques that combine contextual cues and lane information to detect vehicles that pose high threat to the ego-vehicle. The threat analysis is then used for generating a safe maneuver zone by the proposed system, which is implemented by using two Snapdragon 810 embedded CPUs. A detailed performance evaluation and tradeoff analysis is presented using a novel multiperspective dataset (DualCam Dataset) that is released as part of this paper. In terms of accuracy, the detailed evaluations show high robustness with true positive rates greater than 95% with less than 6% false alarm rate. The proposed embedded system operates at real-time frame rates in our testbed under real-world highway driving conditions. The proposed framework was presented as a live demonstration at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Driver anomaly quantification is a fundamental capability to support human-centric driving systems of intelligent vehicles. Existing studies usually treat it as a classification task and obtain discrete levels for abnormalities. Meanwhile, the existing data-driven approaches depend on the quality of dataset and provide limited recognition capability for unknown activities. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a contrastive learning approach with the aim of building a model that can quantify driver anomalies with a continuous variable. In addition, a novel clustering supervised contrastive loss is proposed to optimize the distribution of the extracted representation vectors to improve the model performance. Compared with the typical contrastive loss, the proposed loss can better cluster normal representations while separating abnormal ones. The abnormality of driver activity can be quantified by calculating the distance to a set of representations of normal activities rather than being produced as the direct output of the model. The experiment results with datasets under different modes demonstrate that the proposed approach is more accurate and robust than existing ones in terms of recognition and quantification of unknown abnormal activities.",

    "publication_date": "March 2019",
    "abstract": "The driver steering performance is strongly related to gaze behavior in natural driving. The investigation of gaze behavior is crucial for understanding driver response to driver-automation shared control, which was developed to reduce the workload of drivers while keeping them in the control loop. This study focused on driver gaze behavior and its relationship to the steering performance when driving with different levels of shared control. Shared control was achieved through a haptic guidance steering system, which provided active assistant torques on the steering wheel. A driving simulator experiment was conducted with 15 participants, who drove five trials, each with a different level of shared control: first, no haptic guidance, second, normal haptic guidance, third, strong haptic guidance, fourth, having a driver's hands hovering over the steering wheel as a standby during automated driving, and, fifth, having a driver's hands free for a long time during automated driving. The results show a tendency that the correlation between gaze and steering movements decreased when the automation authority of shared control increased. A reduction in the lead time of gaze over steering movement was found in the condition of strong haptic guidance compared to normal haptic guidance and manual driving. This study suggests the potential of using the relationship between gaze behavior and the steering performance to analyze driver interaction with automation.",

    "abstract": "MmWave (millimeter wave) Frequency Modulated Continuous Waves (FMCW) RADARs are sensors based on frequency-modulated electromagnetic which see their environment in 3D at a long-range. The recent introduction of millimeter-wave RADARs with frequencies from 60 GHz to 300 GHz has broadened their potential applications thanks to their improved accuracy in angle, range, and velocity. MmWave FMCW RADARs have better resolution and accuracy than narrowband and ultra-wideband (UWB) RADARs. In comparison with cameras and LiDARs, they possess several strong advantages such as long-range perception, robustness to lightning, and weather conditions while being cheaper. However, their noisy and lower-density outputs even compared to other technologies of RADARs, and their ability to measure the targets’ velocities require specific algorithms tailored for them. Working principles of mmWave FMCW RADARs are presented as well as the separate ways to represent data and their applications. This paper describes algorithms and applications adapted or developed for these sensors in automotive applications. Finally, current challenges and directions for future works are presented.",

Since a nonparametric Bayesian method with a two-level structure successfully predicted the symbolized behaviors only, we applied a nonparametric Bayesian method with linear dynamical systems to predicting the driving behavior. The method called the beta process autoregressive hidden Markov model (BP-AR-HMM) segments driving behaviors into states each of which corresponds to an AR model and it predicts future behaviors using the estimated future state sequence and the dynamical systems therein. Here, the segmentation as well as the parameters of the dynamical systems are determined using given training data in an unsupervised way.

    "abstract": "RGBT tracking becomes a popular computer vision task, and has a variety of applications in visual surveillance systems, self-driving cars and intelligent transportation system. This paper investigates how to perform robust visual tracking in adverse and challenging conditions using complementary visual and thermal infrared data (RGBT tracking). We propose a novel deep network architecture called quality-aware Feature Aggregation Network (FANet) for robust RGBT tracking. Unlike existing RGBT trackers, our FANet aggregates hierarchical deep features within each modality to dispose the challenge of significant changes in appearance which is triggered by low illumination,deformation, background clutter and occlusion. In particular, we employ the operations of max pooling to transform these hierarchical and multi-resolution features into uniform space with the same resolution, and use 1×1 convolution operation to compress feature dimensions to achieve more effective hierarchical feature aggregation. To model the interactions between RGB and thermal modalities, we elaborately design an adaptive aggregation subnetwork to integrate features from different modalities based on their reliabilities and thus are able to alleviate noise effects introduced by low-quality sources. The whole FANet is trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate the high-accurate performance against other state-of-the-art RGBT tracking methods.",

    "abstract": "Merge scenarios confront drivers with some of the most complicated driving maneuvers in every day driving, requiring anticipatory reasoning of positions of other vehicles, and the own vehicles future trajectory. In congested traffic it might be impossible to merge without cooperation of up-stream vehicles, therefore, it is essential to gauge the effect of our own trajectory when planning a merge maneuver. For an autonomous vehicle to perform a merge maneuver in congested traffic similar capabilities are required. This includes a model describing the future evolution of the scene that allows for optimizing the autonomous vehicle's planned trajectory with respect to risk, comfort, and dynamical limitations. We present a probabilistic model that explicitly models interaction between vehicles and allows for evaluating the utility of a large number of candidate trajectories of an autonomous vehicle using a receding horizon approach in order to select an appropriate merge maneuver. The model is an extension of the intelligent driver model and the modeled behavior of other vehicles are adjusted using on-line model parameter estimation in order to give better predictions. The prediction model is evaluated using naturalistic traffic data and the merge maneuver planner is evaluated in simulation.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2021",
    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Pedestrian communication can extend crash prevention capabilities of the current driver assistance systems in vehicles. This requires vehicles and pedestrians to exchange safety messages with each other. However, as the number of pedestrians increases, the numerous safety messages transmitted by pedestrians can quickly congest the network. This can severely affect Vehicle-to-Pedestrian and Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication. Hence, a mechanism for the mitigation of network congestion caused by pedestrian safety messages is required. This article proposes a Multi-channel Clustering-based Congestion Control (MC-COCO4V2P) algorithm, a proactive and infrastructure-independent clustering-based approach to mitigate the network congestion caused by pedestrians. Our approach clusters pedestrians based on their location and direction and uses separate channels for exchanging cluster and safety messages, thereby reducing the control information overhead. It also employs a transmit power control mechanism to make the clustering mechanism energy efficient. Our results show that the clustering of pedestrians can significantly improve network performance and reduce the power consumption of pedestrians' devices.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have been widely used in autonomous driving systems for the semantic understanding of urban scenes. However, they need a huge amount of labeled data for training, which is difficult and expensive to acquire. A recently proposed workaround is to train deep networks using synthetic data, but the domain shift between real world and synthetic representations limits the performance. In this work, a novel Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy is introduced to solve this issue. The proposed learning strategy is driven by three components: a standard supervised learning loss on labeled synthetic data; an adversarial learning module that exploits both labeled synthetic data and unlabeled real data; finally, a self-teaching strategy applied to unlabeled data. The last component exploits a region growing framework guided by the segmentation confidence. Furthermore, we weighted this component on the basis of the class frequencies to enhance the performance on less common classes. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in adapting a segmentation network trained on synthetic datasets, like GTA5 and SYNTHIA, to real world datasets like Cityscapes and Mapillary.",

    "abstract": "Semantic scene segmentation has primarily been addressed by forming high-level visual representations of single images. The problem of semantic segmentation in dynamic scenes has begun to receive attention with the video object segmentation and tracking problem. While there has been some recent work attempt to use deep learning models on the video level, what is not known is how the temporal dynamics information is contributing to the full scene segmentation. Moreover, most existing datasets only provide full scene annotation on non-consecutive images to ensure the variability of scenes, making it even harder to explore novel methods on video-level modeling. To address the above issues, our work takes steps to explore the behavior of modern spatiotemporal modeling approaches by: 1) constructing the MIT DriveSeg dataset, a large-scale video driving scene segmentation dataset, densely annotated for pixel-level semantic classes with 5000 consecutive video frames, and 2) proposing a joint-learning framework that reveals the contribution of temporal dynamics information in regard to different semantic classes in the driving scene. This work is intended to help assess current methods and support further exploration of the value of temporal dynamics information in video-level scene segmentation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an algorithm for lateral control of a vehicle—a smooth and accurate model predictive controller (MPC). The fundamental difference compared to a standard MPC is that the driving smoothness is directly addressed in the cost function. The controller objective is based on the minimization of the first- and second-order spatial derivatives of the curvature. By doing so, jerky commands to the steering wheel, which could lead to permanent damage on the steering components and vehicle structure, are avoided. A good path tracking accuracy is ensured by adding constraints to avoid deviations from the reference path. Finally, the controller is experimentally tested and evaluated on a Scania construction truck. The evaluation is performed at Scania's facilities near Södertälje, Sweden via two different paths: a precision track that resembles a mining scenario and a high-speed test track that resembles a highway situation. Even using a linearized kinematic vehicle to predict the vehicle motion, the performance of the proposed controller is encouraging, since the deviation from the path never exceeds 30 cm. It clearly outperforms an industrial pure-pursuit controller in terms of path accuracy and a standard MPC in terms of driving smoothness.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Understanding urban scenes is a fundamental ability requirement for assisted driving and autonomous vehicles. Most of the available urban scene understanding methods use red-green-blue (RGB) images; however, their segmentation performances are prone to degradation under adverse lighting conditions. Recently, many effective artificial neural networks have been presented for urban scene understanding and have shown that incorporating RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images can improve segmentation accuracy even under unsatisfactory lighting conditions. However, the potential of multimodal feature fusion has not been fully exploited because operations such as simply concatenating the RGB and thermal features or averaging their maps have been adopted. To improve the fusion of multimodal features and the segmentation accuracy, we propose a multitask-aware network (MTANet) with hierarchical multimodal fusion (multiscale fusion strategy) for RGB-T urban scene understanding. We developed a hierarchical multimodal fusion module to enhance feature fusion and built a high-level semantic module to extract semantic information for merging with coarse features at various abstraction levels. Using the multilevel fusion module, we exploited low-, mid-, and high-level fusion to improve segmentation accuracy. The multitask module uses boundary, binary, and semantic supervision to optimize the MTANet parameters. Extensive experiments were performed on two benchmark RGB-T datasets to verify the improved performance of the proposed MTANet compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>",

    "publication_date": "Dec. 2016",
    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of outlier detection for robust motion estimation by using modern sparse-low-rank decompositions, i.e., Robust PCA-like methods, to impose global rank constraints. Robust decompositions have shown to be good at splitting a corrupted matrix into an uncorrupted low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix, containing outliers. However, this process only works when matrices have relatively low rank with respect to their ambient space, a property not met in motion estimation problems. As a solution, we propose to exploit the partial information present in the decomposition to decide which matches are outliers. We provide evidences showing that even when it is not possible to recover an uncorrupted low-rank matrix, the resulting information can be exploited for outlier detection. To this end we propose the Robust Decomposition with Constrained Rank (RD-CR), a proximal gradient based method that enforces the rank constraints inherent to motion estimation. We also present a general framework to perform robust estimation for stereo Visual Odometry, based on our RD-CR and a simple but effective compressed optimization method that achieves high performance. Our evaluation on synthetic data and on the KITTI dataset demonstrates the applicability of our approach in complex scenarios and it yields state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be on public roads in the near future, but some critical aspects of this reality are yet to be resolved. One of these aspects is the lack of a sufficient safety-performance-verification technique. The existing tools of functional-safety engineering do not provide a comprehensive solution for the verification of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For the verification of this type of algorithms, it has become widely accepted in the recent years that simulation tests should be used. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no detailed method for how these simulation tests should be performed has yet been suggested. To start tackling this gap, this paper presents a verification methodology based on the statistical testing of AVs' safety-related functionality in simulated scenarios. Also, presented here is a test-case implementation of the methodology on a full-scale autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). In this example, the functionality of safe autonomous off-road navigation is verified. It is shown that the statistical performance data that are gathered using simulation can be used to accurately predict the overall safety performance of UGVs in real life. Our intention is that this paper will provide a starting point for the further discussion on the exact way simulation tests shall be used for the safety verification of AVs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of using inertial measurements to position a smartphone with respect to a vehicle-fixed accelerometer. Using rigid body kinematics, this is cast as a nonlinear filtering problem. Unlike previous publications, we consider the complete three-dimensional kinematics, and do not approximate the angular acceleration to be zero. The accuracy of an estimator based on the unscented Kalman filter is compared with the Cramer-Rao bound. As is illustrated, the estimates can be expected to be better in the horizontal plane than in the vertical direction of the vehicle frame. Moreover, implementation issues are discussed and the system model is motivated by observability arguments. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated in a field study which shows that the horizontal RMSE is in the order of 0.5 [m]. Last, the proposed estimator is benchmarked against the state-of-the-art in left/right classification. The framework can be expected to find use in both insurance telematics and distracted driving solutions.",

    "abstract": "Kinodynamic motion planning is critical for autonomous vehicles with high maneuverability in dynamic environments. However, obtaining near-optimal motion planning solutions with low computational costs and inaccurate prior model information is challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes a receding-horizon reinforcement learning approach for kinodynamic motion planning (RHRL-KDP) of autonomous vehicles in the presence of inaccurate dynamics information and moving obstacles. Specifically, a receding-horizon actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm is presented, resulting in a neural network-based planning strategy that can be learned both offline and online. A neural network-based model is built and learned online to approximate the modeling uncertainty of the prior nominal model in order to improve planning performance. Furthermore, active collision avoidance in dynamic environments is realized by constructing safety-related terms in actor and critic networks using potential fields. In theory, the uniformly ultimate boundedness property of the modeling uncertainty’s approximation error is proven, and the convergence of the proposed RHRL-KDP is analyzed. Simulation tests show that our approach outperforms the previously developed motion planners based on model predictive control (MPC), safe RL, and RRT\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${^\\star }$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n in terms of planning performance.

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2021",
    "abstract": "Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have been an effective solution for improved vehicle fuel efficiency and reduced emission pollution. However, the optimization design for HEVs is complicated due to the presence of nonlinear dynamics and complicated integration of the HEV systems. Moreover, there is a trade-off between fuel optimization and emission reduction. In this paper, a co-optimization scheme is proposed to optimize fuel efficiency for HEVs. The proposed optimization scheme uses obtainable future speed prediction as the basis to optimally tune control parameters for the existing powertrain control system. Moreover, the ramp-up time of the catalyst temperature to reach its light-off level in the exhaust emission system is also considered as an additional optimization constraint to reduce emission. At first, the Toyota Prius Hybrid Simulink model which is an integrated model for a powertrain and exhaust emission system is validated using real data from a number of real driving cycle scenarios. Then, to simplify the formulation of the proposed algorithm, the model employed for the optimization for both powertrain and exhaust emission systems is represented by a set of equivalent neural network (NN) models, which are learned using the data generated from the well-validated Toyota Prius Hybrid Simulink model. Using the NN model, a co-optimization algorithm is established that provides an optimal tuning of some fuel-sensitive powertrain control parameters using future speed prediction, leading to a novel co-optimization algorithm, achieving on average a further 9.22% fuel savings for the Toyota Prius Hybrid Simulink model.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for inverse learning of a control objective defined in terms of requirements and their joint probability distribution from data. The probability distribution characterizes tolerated deviations from the deterministic requirements and is learned using maximum likelihood estimation from data. Further, this paper introduces both parametrized requirements for motion planning in autonomous driving applications and methods for the estimation of their parameters from driving data. Both the parametrized requirements and their joint probability distributions are estimated using a posterior distribution such that the control objective is personalized from a prior as driver data are accumulated. Finally, three variants of the learning method are presented that vary in computational complexity and data storage requirements. Key advantages of the proposed inverse learning method are a relatively low computational complexity, a need for a limited amount of data, and that the data do not have to be segmented into specific maneuvers, which makes the method easily implementable. Learning results using data of five human drivers in a simulation environment suggest that the proposed model for human-conscious driving along with the proposed learning method enable a more natural and personalized driving style of autonomous vehicles for their human passengers.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new control strategy for the active steering of a trailers of longer and heavier vehicle combinations is proposed to improve both low speed maneuverability and high speed stability. A novelty of the approach is in the use of a single controller structure for all velocities using a gain scheduling method for optimal performance at any velocity. To achieve such a control objective, the problem is initially formulated as a path following problem and subsequently transformed into a tracking problem using a reference model. To support controller design, a generic nonlinear model of a double articulated vehicle, based on a single track model, is employed. The proposed systematic design approach allows to easily adjust the controller for additional trailers or different dimensions, in which only some of the towed vehicles are allowed to steer. The performance of the controller is verified on a high-fidelity multi-body model for evidencing the practical applicability of the approach. Simulation results show substantial reduction of both, the swept path width and tail swing for low speed, and the rearward amplification for high speed.",

In this paper, wemathematically formulate and study a strategy for improving object localization with a deep convolutional neural network. An iterative region-of-interest pooling framework is proposed for predicting increasingly tight object boxes and addressing limitations in current state-of-the-art deep detection models. The method is shown to significantly improve the performance on a variety of datasets, scene settings, and camera perspectives, producing high-quality object boxes at a minor additional computational expense. Specifically, the architecture achieves impressive gains in performance (up to 6% improvement in detection accuracy) at fast run-time speed (0.22 s per frame on 1242 × 375 sized images). The iterative refinement is shown to impact subsequent vision tasks, such as object tracking in the image plane and in ground plane.",

    "abstract": "Visual attention is one of the most important aspects related to driver distraction. Estimating the driver’s visual attention can help a vehicle understand the awareness state of the driver, providing important contextual information. While estimating the exact gaze direction is difficult in the car environment, a coarse estimation of the visual attention can be obtained by tracking the head pose. Since the relation between head pose and gaze direction is not one-to-one, this paper proposes a formulation based on probabilistic models to create salient regions describing the driver’s visual attention. The area of the estimated region is small when the model has high confidence, which is directly learned from the data. We use \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Gaussian process regression</i>\n (GPR) to implement the framework, comparing the performance with different regression formulations such as linear regression and neural network based methods. We evaluate these frameworks by studying the tradeoff between spatial resolution and accuracy of the probability map using naturalistic recordings collected with the UTDrive platform. We observe that the GPR method produces the best result creating accurate estimations with localized salient regions. For example, the 95% confidence region is defined by an area covering 3.77% region of a sphere surrounding the driver.",

    "abstract": "The application of traction control systems (TCS) for electric vehicles (EV) has great potential due to easy implementation of torque control with direct-drive motors. However, the control system usually requires road-tire friction and slip-ratio values, which must be estimated. While it is not possible to obtain the first one directly, the estimation of latter value requires accurate measurements of chassis and wheel velocity. In addition, existing TCS structures are often designed without considering the robustness and energy efficiency of torque control. In this paper, both problems are addressed with a smart TCS design having an integrated acoustic road-type estimation (ARTE) unit. This unit enables the road-type recognition and this information is used to retrieve the correct look-up table between friction coefficient and slip-ratio. The estimation of the friction coefficient helps the system to update the necessary input torque. The ARTE unit utilizes machine learning, mapping the acoustic feature inputs to road-type as output. In this paper, three existing TCS for EVs are examined with and without the integrated ARTE unit. The results show significant performance improvement with ARTE, reducing the slip ratio by 75% while saving energy via reduction of applied torque and increasing the robustness of the TCS.",

    "abstract": "In highway scenarios, an alert human driver will typically anticipate early cut-in/cut-out maneuvers of surrounding vehicles using visual cues mainly. Autonomous vehicles must anticipate these situations at an early stage too, to increase their safety and efficiency. In this work, lane-change recognition and prediction tasks are posed as video action recognition problems. Up to four different two-stream-based approaches, that have been successfully applied to address human action recognition, are adapted here by stacking visual cues from forward-looking video cameras to recognize and anticipate lane-changes of target vehicles. We study the influence of context and observation horizons on performance, and different prediction horizons are analyzed. The different models are trained and evaluated using the PREVENTION dataset. The obtained results clearly demonstrate the potential of these methodologies to serve as robust predictors of future lane-changes of surrounding vehicles proving an accuracy higher than 90% in time horizons of between 1-2 seconds.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2017.2767289",
    "publication_date": "Dec. 2017",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been significant research on environment-focused connected vehicle (CV) applications that involve determining optimal speed profiles for vehicles traveling through signalized intersections and conveying this information to drivers via driver-vehicle interfaces (DVI's). However, findings from previous studies indicate that drivers may not be able to precisely follow the recommended speed profiles, resulting in degraded effectiveness of the applications. Moreover, the DVI could be distracting, which may compromise safety. As an alternative, partial automation can play an important role in ensuring that the benefits of these CV applications are fully realized. In this study, a partially automated vehicle system with an eco-approach and departure feature (called the GlidePath Prototype), which can receive dedicated short range communication message sets from the intersection and automatically follow recommended speed profiles, was developed, demonstrated, and evaluated. The results revealed that compared to manually following the recommended speed profiles, the GlidePath Prototype reduced fuel consumption by 17% on average. In some cases, the fuel savings are greater than 40% while the travel time is shortened by up to 64%. Furthermore, the system potentially improved the driving comfort since it would smooth out the speed profiles.",

    "publication_date": "March 2022",
    "abstract": "In this paper a learning-based optimization method for online gear shift and velocity control is presented to reduce the fuel consumption and improve the driving comfort in a car-following process. The continuous traction force and the discrete gear shift are optimized jointly to improve both the powertrain operation and the longitudinal motion. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer optimization problem and solved based on adaptive dynamic programming. A major difference compared to existing approaches is that the developed control method is model-free, i.e. it does not rely on vehicle models. It can address system nonlinearities and adapt to changes in engine characteristics (e.g. consumption map) during vehicle driving. The computation is efficient and enables possible real-time implementation. The proposed control method is studied for an urban driving cycle to evaluate the control performance with respect to the fuel economy and the driving comfort. Simulations indicate that the host vehicle can reduce the fuel consumption by 5.03% and 1.12% for two consumption maps in comparison to the preceding while keeping a desired inter-vehicle distance. The results further show a decrease of 1.59% and 2.32% in fuel consumption compared to a linear quadratic controller with the same gear shift schedule.",

First, we design the operating model of the system while taking the interests of both customers and parking garage into consideration. Subsequently, a battery degradation cost model is devised to capture the characteristic of battery performance degradation during the charging process. Taking into account the developed battery degradation cost model, EV charging scheduling problem is explored and a cost minimization problem is formulated. To make the problem tractable, we investigate the features of the problem and decompose the problem into two subproblems. A vacant charging resource allocation algorithm and a dynamic power adjustment algorithm are proposed to obtain the optimal solution of cost minimization. Several simulations based on realistic EV charging settings are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methods in discussed charging scenarios. Simulation results exhibit the superior performance of the proposed algorithms in achieving the most degradation cost reduction and the lowest peak power load compared with other benchmark solutions, which is beneficial for both customers and charging operators.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2020.3017256",
    "publication_date": "March 2021",
    "abstract": "Locating the vehicle in its road is a critical part of any autonomous vehicle system and has been subject to different research topics. In most works presented in the literature, ego-localization is split into three parts: Road level-localization consisting in the road on which the vehicle travels, Lane level localization which is the lane on which the vehicle travels, and Ego lane level localization being the lateral position of the vehicle in the ego-lane. For each part, several researches have been conducted. However, the relationship between the different parts has not been taken into consideration. Through this work, an end-to-end ego-localization framework is introduced with two main novelties. The first one is the proposition of a complete solution that tackles every part of the ego-localization. The second one lies in the information-driven approach used. Indeed, we use prior about the road structure from a digital map in order to reduce the space complexity for the recognition process. Besides, several fusion framework techniques based on Bayesian Network and Hidden Markov Model are elaborated leading to an ego-localization method that is, to a large extent, robust to erroneous sensor data. The robustness of the proposed method is proven on different datasets in varying scenarios.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Despite the advancements in the technologies of autonomous driving, it is still challenging to study the safety of a self-driving vehicle. Trajectory prediction is one core function of an autonomous vehicle. This study proposes an Attention-based Interaction-aware Trajectory Prediction (AI-TP) for traffic agents around the autonomous vehicle. With an encoder-decoder architecture, the AI-TP model uses Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to describe the interactions of traffic agents and Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) to carry out predictions. Based on the attention mechanism, the AI-TP model constructs graphs from various traffic scenes to predict trajectories of different types of traffic agents. Traffic data from both the high-way (i.e., NGSIM) and urban road areas (i.e., ApolloScape and Argoverse) are used to evaluate the performance of the AI-TP model. Numerical results demonstrate that the AI-TP model requires less inference time and achieves better prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the AI-TP model improves the performance with much less inference time on the NGSIM dataset, which shows the promise of predicting trajectories under various scenarios. The code of the AI-TP model will be available at \n<uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/KP-Zhang/AI-TP</uri>\n.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles differ from many other autonomous systems in the sense that these vehicles have to share the environment with humans (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers in traffic). This requirement poses a challenging perception and planning problem. Our research focuses on the problem of a vehicle sharing the environment with a human passenger/driver and, specifically, of designing a controller that captures the natural tendencies of the human driver so as to guarantee that the resulting control action is comparable to that of the human. In this paper, we propose to use a human driver control model into the autonomous vehicle control framework, which has previously been shown to predict short-term driver actions, and we develop an approach that reliably and accurately estimates input-feature values from driver-point-of-view images. After the feature-input values have been estimated, the human driver control model computes the corresponding steering-wheel angle. We, thus, provide more structure to the overall processing pipeline, compared to the recent end-to-end approaches. The proposed approach is validated using numerical simulations with synthetic images. The results validate the importance of combining traditional structured (e.g., transfer function) models with parsimonious neural-network representations.",

    "abstract": "To support safe driving, numerous methods of detecting distractions using measurements of a driver's gaze have been proposed. These methods empirically focused on certain driving contexts and analyzed gaze behavior under particular peripheral vehicle conditions; therefore, numerous driving situations were not considered. To address this problem with hypothesis-testing approaches, we turn the problem around and propose a data-mining approach that analyzes peripheral vehicle behavior during gaze transitions of drivers in order to compare their neutral driving state with a cognitive distraction state. This change in thinking is the first contribution of this paper. The analysis results show that under the neutral condition, drivers generally turned their gaze to peripheral vehicles to be focused on; however, they did not do this consistently under the distracted condition. As the second contribution, we propose a simple classifier to discriminate between the cognitive distraction and neutral states by analyzing the peripheral vehicle behavior. The proposed classifier can manage various situations and provide high classification accuracy by focusing on gaze transitions from the front view toward other directions.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with distributed cooperative longitudinal platooning control of connected automated vehicles over resource-constrained vehicular ad-hoc networks. First, a general platoon-based control framework is constructed, which simultaneously accounts for unknown leader control input, external disturbances, intermittent data samplings and transmissions, various spacing policies, and different vehicle-to-vehicle communication topologies. To alleviate excessive occupancy of the limited communication resources, an adaptive Zeno-free event-triggered communication mechanism is developed to determine when the sampling and transmission actions of vehicular data should be performed among interacting vehicles. Then, a scalable co-design approach for the desired adaptive platoon controller as well as event triggering condition is developed. One promising feature of the proposed platooning control strategy is that it is independent on the platoon scale or any global knowledge of the associated communication topology, and thus implementable on each vehicle in a scalable manner. Finally, several numerical case studies are conducted to verify the efficacy of the derived approach.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a method for real-time integrated motion planning and control aimed at autonomous vehicles. Our method leverages feedback control, positive invariant sets, and equilibrium trajectories of the closed-loop system to produce and track trajectories that are collision-free with guarantees according to the vehicle model. Our method jointly steers the vehicle to a target region and controls the velocity while satisfying constraints associated with future motion of surrounding obstacles. We develop a receding-horizon implementation of the control policy and verify the method in both a simulated road scenario and an experimental validation using a scaled mobile robot with car-like dynamics using only onboard sensing. The results show that our method generates dynamically feasible and safe (i.e., collision-free) trajectories in real time, and indicate that the proposed planner is robust to sensing and mapping errors.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we quantify the impacts of model fidelity on the effectiveness of trajectory optimization for autonomous vehicles when driving at the limits of friction through experiments with a full-size vehicle. Models ranging from a double-track model with lateral and longitudinal load transfer dynamics to a simple point-mass model are used in combination with direct numerical optimization to generate optimal trajectories subject to the limits imposed by each model. The effectiveness of each model for trajectory planning is evaluated by testing the trajectories on an automated vehicle across friction conditions ranging from ice to dry asphalt. Comparisons between the outright performance of the car and the car's ability to track the optimal trajectory are made across the various models. The tests reveal that the advantage of more complex models is less that they better predict the vehicle's behavior, but that they provide a more nuanced view of the vehicle's limits and guidance on the proper coordination of the various actuators on the vehicle in order to make most efficient use of the available tire friction.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method of accurate dead reckoning in urban areas using low-cost sensors. In the evolution of advanced driver assistance systems, the seamless and accurate positioning of the vehicle has become one of the most important tasks, and dead reckoning plays an important role. Visual odometry is one of the most attractive approaches for this dead reckoning, but in urban areas, the accuracy of visual odometry is degraded due to the surrounding moving objects. Moreover, the error of heading estimation used with the visual odometry cannot be corrected with satellite information, due to poor satellite signal reception. In this study, solutions of these problems are presented to improve the accuracy of the visual odometry in urban environments. The first key technique is moving object detection using inertial measurement unite (IMU) and pattern recognition, which improves the robustness of visual odometry in the dynamic environments. The second key technique is heading estimation using time-series tightly coupled integration of satellite Doppler shift and IMU, which makes heading correction possible where there is poor satellite reception. In evaluation experiments in urban areas, the error of dead reckoning using this proposed method is reduced to about one-fourth compared to the conventional approach.",

    "abstract": "The autonomous vehicle studiesrecently have been accelerated to ensure more secure, efficient, and comfortable transportation. Non-linearity in the power-train makes longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles difficult at low speeds. Additionally, rapid acceleration and deceleration (due to the behavior of the surrounding vehicles) increase complexity in control of such systems. In this study, we designed a novel longitudinal controller including the reverse plant model of the vehicle to overcome these problems. The complete controller is designed using parameters known to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) with vehicle CAN bus signals. The longitudinal controller consists of two parts: The outer controller which determines the target speed according to lead vehicle’s speed and the inner controller which determines the accelerator pedal percentage and brake requests. The inner controller includes PI followed by the reverse plant model with a virtual load sensor. This model enables control of a vehicle with non-linear power-train. The designed controller performance was tested on a city bus with a diesel engine and automatic transmission. Vehicle test results proved, that the designed controller is capable of controlling an autonomous vehicle with nonlinear power-train dynamics with onboard computational capacity even at low speeds.",

    "abstract": "The naturalistic driving study (NDS) data offers a rare opportunity for a first-hand view of crashes and near-crashes (CNC) that occur around work zones. The objective of this study is twofold: 1) evaluate risk of CNC using pre-incident variables using logistical regression models and; 2) classify and predict CNC events using machine learning methods. The regression models found that driving behavior, duration of secondary task and traffic density exerted a high influence on risk of CNC in work zones. Odds of a safety critical event for different risk factors followed similar trend for work zones and non-work zones. Duration of secondary task and traffic density variables contributed to increased crash risk in work zones than non-work zones. For the second objective, four machine learning algorithms: Random forest (RF), Deep Neural Network, Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network, and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), were applied to work zone events and non-work zone events within NDS data. The RF algorithm performed the best in classifying CNC events occurring in work zones. The prediction accuracy was 86.3% for three classes: crash, near-crash, and baseline and 91.2% for two classes: crash and near-crash. For non-work zone data, the Deep Neural Network model outperformed others in differentiating between crash and near-crash events.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive cruise control is one of the most common comfort features of road vehicles. Despite its large market penetration, current systems are not safe in all driving conditions and require supervision by human drivers. While several previous works have proposed solutions for safe adaptive cruise control, none of these works considers comfort, especially in the event of cut-ins. We provide a novel solution that simultaneously meets our specifications and provides comfort in all driving conditions, including cut-ins. This is achieved by an exchangeable nominal controller ensuring comfort, combined with a provably correct fail-safe controller that gradually engages an emergency maneuver-this ensures comfort, since most threats are already cleared before emergency braking is fully activated. As a consequence, one can easily exchange the nominal controller without having to have the overall system safety re-certified. We also provide the first user study into a provably-correct adaptive cruise controller. It shows that even though our approach never causes an accident, passengers rate the performance as good as a state-of-the-art solution that does not ensure safety.",

The central goal is to develop a resource-efficient communication and active suspension control co-design approach such that the limited in-vehicle network resources are occupied in an efficient manner, while simultaneously achieving the desired suspension system performance. For this purpose, a networked data transmission framework, incorporating a dynamic event-triggered communication mechanism and a logarithmic quantizer, is developed to accommodate the intermittent and digitalized packet-based transmissions over the in-vehicle controller area network channels. Specifically, the event triggering mechanism sporadically selects the sampled sensor data packets to be transmitted, which are then quantized before sending over the network channels. Then, formal stability and suspension performance analysis is carried out, and a co-design criterion on the existence of the desired triggering mechanism and event-triggered output feedback controller is further derived. Finally, the effectiveness and merits of the derived results are substantiated via several numerical case studies.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2018",
    "abstract": "The fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of vehicles can significantly be reduced by adding an electric drivetrain to the internal combustion engine (ICE) without deteriorating the vehicle performance. One of the best suggestions to achieve such a goal is plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In PHEVs, the design of an efficient energy management strategy plays a significant role. In this paper, a new control strategy is proposed for parallel PHEV to keep the ICE operation points close to the high-efficiency region, while minimizing the fuel consumption over the standardized drive cycles. First, a new high efficiency ICE on/off control strategy is designed. Second, the teaching-learning based optimization algorithm is used to optimize the proposed control strategy and find the optimal ICE operation region. In the rule-based controllers, the ICE operates within predefined constant efficiency region without incorporating the driving pattern. However, the proposed controller can optimally tune the ICE operation points based on each driving scenario to achieve a better fuel economy. Since the control strategy of PHEVs highly depends on the driving patterns, three different drive cycles with three different trip distances and one recharging opportunity during the trip are considered to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in terms of the fuel economy and the ICE efficiency. The results illustrate that the proposed control strategy could greatly decrease the fuel consumption of the PHEV under all driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the similarity levels of driving behavior plays a pivotal role in driving style classification and analysis, thus benefiting the design of human-centric driver assistance systems. This article presents a novel framework capable of quantitatively measuring the similarity of driving behaviors for human based on driving primitives, i.e., the building blocks of driving behavior. To this end, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric method by integrating hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) with a hidden Markov model (HMM) in order to automatically extract the driving primitives from sequential observations without using any prior knowledge. Then, we propose a grid-based relative entropy approach, which allows quantifying the probabilistic similarity levels among these extracted primitives. Finally, the naturalistic driving data from 10 drivers are collected to evaluate the proposed framework, with comparison to traditional work. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed probabilistic framework based on driving primitives can provide a quantitative measurement of similar levels of driving behavior associated with the dynamic and stochastic characteristics.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method to dynamically harmonize the behaviors of cyclic vehicular platoons in a closed road network. Different from the open-chain counterpart, a cyclic platoon formulates a traffic flow ring constrained by interconnection coupling feature and finite-length geometry, which brings challenges for platoon control design and analysis. First, by exploiting the circulant structure of homogeneous cyclic platoons, the closed-loop dynamics is decomposed into a set of decoupled systems with the same low dimension as a single vehicle. Based on this decomposition, an analytical necessary and sufficient stability condition is derived for the design of distributed feedback controllers. This necessary and sufficient condition is further relaxed into sufficient conditions to remove the dependence on the platoon size. Next, the string stability is proved with the sufficient conditions derived above based on frequency-domain analysis. Then, based on integral sliding mode control, we prove that heterogeneous vehicles can behave like homogeneous ones so that the results on homogeneous cyclic platoons can be extended to heterogeneous cyclic platoons. Finally, the equilibrium velocity and spacing errors are derived to explain the effect of geometry conditions on the steady-state behavior. Numerical simulations using both linear and nonlinear vehicle models are conducted to validate our findings.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Automotive radar provides reliable environmental perception in all-weather conditions with affordable cost, but it hardly supplies semantic and geometry information due to the sparsity of radar detection points. With the development of automotive radar technologies in recent years, instance segmentation becomes possible by using automotive radar. Its data contain contexts such as radar cross section and micro-Doppler effects, and sometimes can provide detection when the field of view is obscured. The outcome from instance segmentation could be potentially used as the input of trackers for tracking targets. The existing methods often utilize a clustering-based classification framework, which fits the need of real-time processing but has limited performance due to minimum information provided by sparse radar detection points. In this paper, we propose an efficient method based on clustering of estimated semantic information to achieve instance segmentation for the sparse radar detection points. In addition, we show that the performance of the proposed approach can be further enhanced by incorporating the visual multi-layer perceptron. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental results on the popular RadarScenes dataset, achieving 89.53% mean coverage and 86.97% mean average precision with the IoU threshold of 0.5, which is superior to other approaches in the literature. More significantly, the consumed memory is around 1MB, and the inference time is less than 40 ms, indicating that our proposed algorithm is storage and time efficient. These two criteria ensure the practicality of the proposed method in real-world systems.",

    "abstract": "Self-driving vehicles need to continuously analyse the driving scene, understand the behavior of other road users and predict their future trajectories in order to plan a safe motion and reduce their reaction time. Motivated by this idea, this paper addresses the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction over an extended horizon. On highways, human drivers continuously adapt their speed and paths according to the behavior of their neighboring vehicles. Therefore, vehicles' trajectories are very correlated and considering vehicle interactions makes motion prediction possible even before the start of a clear maneuver pattern. To this end, we introduce and analyze trajectory prediction methods based on how they model the vehicles interactions. Inspired by human reasoning, we use an attention mechanism that explicitly highlights the importance of neighboring vehicles with respect to their future states. We go beyond pairwise vehicle interactions and model higher order interactions. Moreover, the existence of different goals and driving behaviors induces multiple potential futures. We exploit a combination of global and partial attention paid to surrounding vehicles to generate different possible trajectory. Experiments on highway datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art performances.",

    "abstract": "To date, numerous cooperative merging techniques have been developed, with multiple studies demonstrating their potential to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and environmental impact at merging points. However, many of these techniques make assumptions that will almost certainly be questionable in the real world, namely: 1) relative positioning between vehicles will be sufficiently accurate at all times; 2) the merging application-equipped vehicles will not change lanes before reaching the merge point, nor will other vehicles change lanes into their lane; and 3) vehicles with merging-assist technology will not mix with vehicles without the technology. This paper proposes a cooperative merging application which is capable of functioning even when the vehicle's positioning accuracy is severely degraded and all vehicles are free to change lanes into and out of the merging traffic streams. Furthermore, our strategy demonstrates safety, efficiency, and environmental benefits for the overall traffic stream even with technology penetration rates as low as 20%.",

    "abstract": "Supervised object detection models based on deep learning technologies cannot perform well in domain shift scenarios where annotated data for training is always insufficient. To this end, domain adaptation technologies for knowledge transfer have emerged to handle the domain shift problems. A stepwise domain adaptive YOLO (S-DAYOLO) framework is developed which constructs an auxiliary domain to bridge the domain gap and uses a new domain adaptive YOLO (DAYOLO) in cross-domain object detection tasks. Different from the previous solutions, the auxiliary domain is composed of original source images and synthetic images that are translated from source images to the similar ones in the target domain. DAYOLO based on YOLOv5s is designed with a category-consistent regularization module and adaptation modules for image-level and instance-level features to generate domain invariant representations. Our proposed method is trained and evaluated by using five public driving datasets including Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, BDD100K, KITTI, and KAIST. Experiment results demonstrate that object detection performance is significantly improved when using our proposed method in various domain shift scenarios for autonomous driving applications.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, various versions of the eco-approach and departure (EAD) application have been developed and evaluated. This application utilizes signal phase and timing information to allow connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to approach and depart from a signalized intersection in an energy-efficient manner. To date, most existing works have studied the EAD application from an ego-vehicle perspective (Ego-EAD) using vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, while relatively limited research takes into account cooperation among vehicles at intersections via vehicle-to-vehicle communication. In this paper, we developed a cluster-wise cooperative EAD (Coop-EAD) application for CAVs to further reduce energy consumption compared to existing Ego-EAD applications. Instead of considering CAVs traveling through signalized intersections one at a time, our approach strategically coordinates CAVs' maneuvers to form clusters using various operating modes: initial vehicle clustering, intracluster sequence optimization, and cluster formation control. The novel Coop-EAD algorithm is applied to the cluster leader, and CAVs in the cluster follow the cluster leader to conduct EAD maneuvers. A preliminary simulation study with a given scenario shows that, compared to an Ego-EAD application, the proposed Coop-EAD application achieves 11% reduction on energy consumption, up to 18% reduction on pollutant emissions, and 50% increase on traffic throughput, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles are becoming more popular all over the world. With increasing battery capacities and a growing fast-charging infrastructure, they are becoming suitable for long-distance travel. However, queues at charging stations could lead to long waiting times, making efficient route planning even more important. In general, optimal multi-objective route planning is extremely computationally expensive. We propose an adaptive charging and routing strategy, which considers driving, waiting, and charging time. For this, we developed a multi-criterion shortest-path search algorithm using contraction hierarchies. To further reduce the computational effort, we precompute shortest-path trees between the known locations of the charging stations. We propose a central charging station database (CSDB) that helps estimating waiting times at charging stations ahead of time. This enables our adaptive charging and routing strategy to reduce these waiting times. In an extensive set of simulation experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of our concept, which reduces average waiting times at charging stations by up to \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$97 \\,\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n. Even if only a subset of the cars uses the CSDB approach, we can substantially reduce waiting times and thereby the total travel time of electric vehicles.",

    "abstract": "We address joint extrinsic calibration of lidar, camera and radar sensors. To simplify calibration, we propose a single calibration target design for all three modalities, and implement our approach in an open-source tool with bindings to Robot Operating System (ROS). Our tool features three optimization configurations, namely using error terms for a minimal number of sensor pairs, or using terms for all sensor pairs in combination with loop closure constraints, or by adding terms for structure estimation in a probabilistic model. Apart from relative calibration where relative transformations between sensors are computed, our work also addresses absolute calibration that includes calibration with respect to the mobile robot's body. Two methods are compared to estimate the body reference frame using an external laser scanner, one based on markers and the other based on manual annotation of the laser scan. In the experiments, we evaluate the three configurations for relative calibration. Our results show that using terms for all sensor pairs is most robust, especially for lidar to radar, when minimum five board locations are used. For absolute calibration the median rotation error around the vertical axis reduces from 1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">°</sup>\n before calibration, to 0.33\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">°</sup>\n using the markers and 0.02\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">°</sup>\n with manual annotations.",

    "publication_date": "March 2020",
    "abstract": "In this article, a method for the automated adaptive tuning of a Bayesian localization filter is investigated, since the tuning parameters were often only empirically determined and constantly set. The method is applied to a previously developed Bayesian localization filter called Odometry 2.0 estimator. Its architecture makes it feasible to individually combine different dead-reckoning models because the input is redundant. However, under different driving-conditions (DCs), in particular when parking, the models have individual advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, different cluster analysis methods are examined in order to automatically divide a parking maneuver into different useful segments and to enable dc-dependent optimization. In the next step these segments and statistical error and coefficient models serve as input for a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The error model provides potential sensor errors to ensure robust filter tuning and the coefficient model provides randomly found filter settings in the large parameter space. Finally, the MCS results and ground truth data are used for the optimization to find the filter tuning with minor model errors. The application of the so found adaptive tuning setting shows a significant increase in the robustness of the localization filter.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2018",
    "abstract": "Modeling and estimating the current local environment by processing sensor measurement data is essential for intelligent vehicles. Static obstacles, dynamic objects, and free space have to be appropriately represented, classified, and filtered. Occupancy grids, known for mapping static environments, provide a common low-level representation using occupancy probabilities with an implicit data association through the discrete grid structure. Extending this idea toward dynamic environments with moving objects requires a static/dynamic classification of measured occupancy and a tracking of the dynamic state of grid cells. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic grid mapping approach. An evidential representation using the Dempster-Shafer framework is used to model hypotheses for static occupancy, dynamic occupancy, free space, and their combined hypotheses. These hypotheses are consistently estimated and accumulated in a dynamic grid map by an adapted evidential filtering, allowing one to distinguish static and dynamic occupancy. The evidential grid mapping is combined with a low-level particle filter tracking that is used to estimate cell velocity distributions and predict dynamic occupancy of the grid map. Static occupancy is directly modeled in the grid map without requiring particles, increasing efficiency, and improving the static/dynamic classification due to the persistent map accumulation. Experimental results with real sensor data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in challenging scenarios with occlusions and dense traffic.",

    "abstract": "Much effort is put right now into how to make autonomous vehicles as capable as possible in order to be able to replace humans as drivers. Less focus is put into how to ensure that this transition happens in a safe way that we can put trust in. The verification of the extreme dependability requirements connected to safety is expected to be one of the largest challenges to overcome in the commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Using traditional statistical methods to validate complete vehicle safety would require the vehicle to cover extreme distances to show that collisions occur rare enough. However, recent research has shown the possibility of using near-collisions in order to estimate the frequency of actual collisions using Extreme Value Theory. To use this method, there is a need for a measure related to the closeness of a collision. This paper shows that the choice of this threat measure has a significant impact on the inferences drawn from the data. With the right measure, this method can be used to validate the safety of a vehicle. This, while keeping the validity high and the data required lower than the state of the art statistical methods.",

In this paper, we therefore present Risk Maps (RM) for online warning support in situations with forced lane changes, due to the end of roads. For this purpose, we first unify sensor data in a Relational Local Dynamic Map (R-LDM). RM is afterwards able to be run in real-time and efficiently probes a range of situations in order to determine risk-minimizing behaviors. Hereby, we focus on the improvement of uncertainty-awareness and transparency of the system. Risk, utility and comfort costs are included in a single formula and are intuitively visualized to the driver. In the conducted experiments, a low-cost sensor setup with a GNSS receiver for localization and multiple cameras for object detection are leveraged. The final system is successfully applied on two-lane roads and recommends lane change advices, which are separated in gap and no-gap indications. These results are promising and present an important step towards interpretable safety.",

    "abstract": "The problem of intent understanding between highly and fully automated vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians in urban traffic environment has got some momentum over the past few years. Previous work has been tackling the problem using two common approaches, namely dynamical motion modeling and motion planning. In this paper, a novel radical end-to-end data-driven approach is proposed for long-term intent prediction of VRUs in urban traffic environment based solely on their motion trajectories. In the proposed approach, we utilized the widely adopted architecture of recurrent neural networks with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) modules to form a deep stacked LSTM network. Three common approaches used in the literature were compared against our proposed approach over two different real-world datasets involving pedestrians collected from vehicle-based stereo cameras. The results over the testing datasets showed that the proposed approach achieved higher accuracies over most of the scenarios of the testing datasets with a small mean lateral position error of 0.48 m. Moreover, the proposed approach showed also a significant generalization capability over totally unobserved testing scenes during the training phase with only 0.58 m in mean lateral position error.",

    "abstract": "AI-based lane detection algorithms were actively studied over the last few years. Many have demonstrated superior performance compared with traditional feature-based methods. However, most methods remain riddled with assumptions and limitations, still not good enough for safe and reliable driving in the real world. In this paper, we propose a novel lane detection system, called Scene Understanding Physics-Enhanced Real-time (SUPER) algorithm. The proposed method consists of two main modules: 1) a hierarchical semantic segmentation network as the scene feature extractor and 2) a physics enhanced multi-lane parameter optimization module for lane inference. We train the proposed system using heterogeneous data from Cityscapes, Vistas and Apollo, and evaluate the performance on four completely separate datasets (that were never seen before), including Tusimple, Caltech, URBAN KITTI-ROAD, and Mcity-3000. The proposed approach performs the same or better than lane detection models already trained on the same dataset, and performs well even on datasets that was never trained on. Real-world vehicle tests were also conducted. Preliminary test results show promising real-time lane-detection performance compared with the Mobileye.",

    "publication_date": "June 2019",
    "abstract": "Many companies aim for delivering systems for autonomous driving reaching out for SAE Level 5. As these systems run much more complex software than typical premium cars of today, a thorough testing strategy is needed. Early prototyping of such systems can be supported using recorded data from onboard and surrounding sensors as long as open-loop testing is applicable; later, though, closed-loop testing is necessary-either by testing on the real vehicle or by using a virtual testing environment. This paper is a substantial extension of our work presented at the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) that was surveying the area of publicly available driving datasets. Our previous results are extended by additional datasets and complemented with a summary of publicly available virtual testing environments to support closed-loop testing. As such, a steadily growing number of 37 datasets for open-loop testing and 22 virtual testing environments for closed-loop testing have been surveyed in detailed. Thus, conducting research toward autonomous driving is significantly supported from complementary community efforts: A growing number of publicly accessible datasets allow for experiments with perception approaches or training and testing machine-learning-based algorithms, while virtual testing environments enable end-to-end simulations.",

It is created from an improved convolutional neural network, which has two input layers to adapt to the processing of high-dimensional environments. Considering the maneuverability of underactuated AUV under current disturbance, especially, the issue of ocean current disturbance under unknown environments, a dynamic and composite reward function is developed to enable the AUV to reach the destination with obstacle avoidance.

The proposed roadmap generation algorithm takes as an input manually designed geometric information of a parking lot consisting of parking space layout, obstacle configuration, and a set of geometric features called guidelines. It constructs a roadmap by dividing the guidelines in multiple resolutions until it achieves enough coverage over the set of safe trajectories satisfying vehicle kinematics, curvature limit, and collision-avoidance. Using this roadmap, a complex parking trajectory composed of both forward and reverse motions can be computed with small online computation cost. The proposed method is evaluated in both numerical simulations and real experiments.",

For potential future advanced driver assistance systems, this can facilitate the situation analysis and risk assessment at road intersections, helping to improve the protection of vulnerable road users. After extracting recorded driving data for nine intersections (featuring over 50 000 crossings) from a database, they are assigned to possible routes and transformed from a time-based representation to a distance-based one. Using random decision forests, the route intent can be predicted with a mean unweighted average recall (UAR) of 0.76 at 30 m before the relevant intersection center, the stopping intent prediction scores a mean UAR of 0.78.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers cooperative control of interconnected intelligent surface vehicles (ISV) moving in a complex water surface containing multiple static/dynamic obstacles. Each ISV is subject to control force and moment constraints, in addition to internal model uncertainties and external disturbances induced by wind, waves and currents. A general safety-certified cooperative control architecture capable of achieving various collective behaviors such as consensus, containment, enclosing, and flocking, is proposed. Specifically, a distributed motion generator is used to generate desired reference signals for each ISV. Robust-exact-differentiators-based (RED-based) extended state observers (ESOs) are designed for recovering unknown total disturbances in finite time. With the aid of control Lyapunov functions, input-to-state safe high order control barrier functions and RED-based ESOs, constrained quadratic optimization problems are formulated to generate optimal surge force and yaw moment without violating the input, stability, safety constraints. In order to facilitate real-time implementations, a one-layer recurrent neural network is employed to solve the constrained quadratic optimization problem on board. It is proved that all tracking errors of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the multi-ISV system is input-to-state safe. An example is given to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed general safety-certified cooperative control architecture.",

    "abstract": "On-Demand electric vehicle (EV) systems are expected to play a significantly increasing role in near future urban transportation systems, to cope with the massive increases in urban population and reduce global carbon emissions. One inconvenience in MoD-EV systems is the need of some customers to perform in-routing charging, which may cause delays in the trip time. Moreover, the customer choice of which station to charge at is an operational issue for the MoD-EV service operator due to the different pricing for the charging at different stations. Given a connected system, we propose a routing scheme that aims to reduce these inconveniences for both customers and the operator. By modeling the routing problem between multiple MoD-EV stations as a multi-server queuing system, we formulate the joint problem of minimizing the average trip time for all customers and the average cost of charging as a dual-objective convex optimization problem. Single and multiple servers per charging stations are considered. Optimal routing decisions are derived analytically for any arbitrary weighting of the two problem objectives and simulation results show the significant merits of our proposed solution as compared to shortest time and random routing decisions. They also illustrate the trade-offs between the two objectives.",

    "publication_date": "Dec. 2018",
    "abstract": "To reduce the number of collision fatalities at crossroads intersections, many countries have started replacing intersections with non-signalized roundabouts, forcing the drivers to be more situationally aware and to adapt their behaviors according to the scenario. A non-signalized roundabout adds to the autonomous vehicle planning challenge, as navigating such interaction-dependent scenarios safely, efficiently, and comfortably has been a challenge even for human drivers. Unlike traffic signal-controlled roundabouts, where the merging order is centrally controlled, driving a non-signalized roundabout requires the individual actor to make the decision to merge based on the movement of other interacting actors. Most traditional autonomous planning approaches use rule-based speed assignment for generating admissible motion trajectories, which work successfully in non-interaction-based driving scenarios. They, however, are less effective in interaction-based scenarios as they lack the necessary ability to adapt the vehicle's motion according to the evolving driving scenario. In this paper, we demonstrate an adaptive tactical behavior planner (ATBP) for an autonomous vehicle that is capable of planning human-like motion behaviors for navigating a non-signalized roundabout, combining naturalistic behavior planning and tactical decision-making algorithm. The human driving simulator experiment used to learn the behavior planning approach and the ATBP design is described in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle automation is used to increase traffic throughput and road safety. Automated vehicles should be highly versatile to navigate on both highways and urban roads. To do so, fully automated autonomous vehicles often adopt motion planners to ensure collision-free and comfortable trajectories. In contrast, in cooperative driving, feedback control is often used to achieve string-stable vehicle-following at very short inter-vehicle distances. In this work, the gap between cooperative vehicle following and trajectory planning is bridged, by using a trajectory planner to generate cooperative trajectories, such that the versatility of an autonomous vehicle is retained, but cooperation is included. The presented method uses B-splines to generate cooperative trajectories. Simulations are used to demonstrate that even under large communication delays, string stable behaviour can be achieved. The use of parametrized trajectories in the form of B-splines ensures only a small number of parameters needs to be communicated between vehicles.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Cooperative driving shows great potential to improve traffic safety and efficiency and has been well discussed in recent years. However, most existing studies focus on ideal traffic environments and ignore potential vehicle failures in traffic systems, which pose significant threats to traffic safety. Therefore, the fault-tolerant capacity of the existing cooperative driving strategies is questionable. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes a fault-tolerant cooperative driving strategy for signal-free intersections by modeling potential vehicle failure types, aiming to keep a good balance between traffic safety and efficiency. Notably, a rule-based fault-tolerant model is constructed to mitigate the threat of potential vehicle failures to traffic safety and efficiency, and to effectively recover the cooperative driving system after vehicle failures occur. Theoretical analysis and simulation results jointly demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed model in achieving fault tolerance and improving traffic efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Safety is of paramount importance in automated driving. One of the main challenges ensuring safety is the unknown future behavior of surrounding traffic participants. Previous works ignore this uncertainty or often address it by computing probability distributions of other traffic participants over time. Probabilistic approaches make it possible to predict the collision probability with other traffic participants, but cannot formally guarantee (i.e., cannot mathematically prove for given assumptions) whether a planned maneuver is collision-free. Our approach addresses exactly this problem: instead of computing probability distributions, we compute an over-approximation of all possible occupancies of surrounding traffic participants over time. This makes it possible to prove whether an automated vehicle can possibly collide with other traffic participants. The presented algorithm for occupancy prediction works on arbitrary road networks and produces results within a fraction of the prediction horizon. Experiments based on real-world data validate our approach and show that we could not find a behavior of a traffic participant that is not enclosed in our prediction.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) is a potential solution to decrease traffic jams caused by shock waves, increase the road capacity, decrease fuel consumption and improve safety. This paper proposes an integrated solution to a combination of four challenges in these CACC systems. One of the technological challenges is how to guarantee string stability (the ability to avoid amplification of dynamic vehicle responses along the string of vehicles) under nominal operational conditions. The second challenge is how to apply this solution to heterogeneous vehicles. The third challenge is how to maintain confidentiality of the vehicle parameters. Finally, the fourth challenge is to find a method which improves robustness against wireless packet loss. This paper proposes a model predictive control approach in combination with a feed-forward control design, which is based on a shared vector of predicted accelerations over a finite time horizon. This approach is shown to be applicable to a heterogeneous sequence of vehicles, while the vehicle parameters remain confidential. In previous works such an approach has shown to increase robustness against packet losses. Conditions for string stability are presented for the nominal operational conditions. Experimental results are presented and indeed demonstrate string stable behavior.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2022",
    "abstract": "How many scenarios are sufficient to validate the safe Operational Design Domain (ODD) of an Automated Driving System (ADS) equipped vehicle? Is a more significant number of sampled scenarios guaranteeing a more accurate safety assessment of the ADS? Despite the various empirical success of ADS safety evaluation with scenario sampling in practice, some of the fundamental properties are largely unknown. This paper seeks to remedy this gap by formulating and tackling the scenario sampling safety assurance problem from a set invariance perspective. First, a novel conceptual equivalence is drawn between the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">scenario sampling safety assurance problem</i>\n and the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">data-driven robustly controlled forward invariant set validation and quantification problem</i>\n. This paper then provides a series of complete solutions with finite-sampling analyses for the safety validation problem that authenticates a given ODD. On the other hand, the quantification problem escalates the validation challenge and starts looking for a safe sub-domain of a particular property. This inspires various algorithms that are provably probabilistic incomplete, probabilistic complete but sub-optimal, and asymptotically optimal. Finally, the proposed asymptotically optimal scenario sampling safety quantification algorithm is also empirically demonstrated through simulation experiments.",

    "abstract": "For continuous performance optimization of camera sensor systems in automated driving, training data from rare corner cases occurring in series production cars are required. In this article, we propose collaborative acquisition of camera images via connected car fleets for synthesis of image sequences from arbitrary road sections which are challenging for machine vision. While allowing a scalable hardware architecture inside the cars, this concept demands to reconstruct the recording locations of the individual images aggregated in the back-end. Varying environmental conditions, dynamic scenes, and small numbers of significant landmarks may hamper camera pose estimation through sparse reconstruction from unordered road scene images. Tackling those problems, we extend a state-of-the-art Structure from Motion pipeline by selecting keypoints based on a semantic image segmentation and removing GPS outliers. We present three challenging image datasets recorded on repetitive test drives under differing environmental conditions for evaluation of our method. The results demonstrate that our optimized pipeline is able to reconstruct the camera viewpoints robustly in the majority of road scenes observed while preserving high image registration rates. Reducing the median deviation from GPS measurements by over 48% for car fleet images, the method increases the accuracy of camera poses dramatically.",

Unconnected human-driven vehicles will follow variable behavior patterns that combine with differences in dynamic capability to create heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, connected automated vehicles employ model predictive control for following in traffic that may include both heavy and passenger vehicles at quasi-random positions. Adding further realism, some quasi-randomly mixed vehicles are completely unconnected and equipped with the reactive intelligent driver model using pseudorandom parameters. A mixed-integer quadratic programming formulation adapts the predictive algorithm to diverse powertrain operating point constraints. The preceding vehicle's control input is estimated from velocity and brake light observations and used to probabilistically generate a preview for the ego vehicle. A terminal constraint designed using particle kinematics prevents collisions due to shortsightedness. Results are simulated at various heavy and predictive vehicle concentrations in the presence of packet loss. Linear fuel economy improvements between 1.4% and 1.9% per 10% increase in predictive vehicle penetration rate are shown.",

    "abstract": "A routing algorithm that leads to extended driving range and battery longevity of electric vehicles (EV) is proposed. In addition to locating the time and energy efficient routes, the proposed algorithm provides a desired speed profile to be tracked by the driver. Data mining techniques are employed for extracting the desired speed profile for the goal driver from a set of historical driving data. In order to select data with strong analogy to those of the goal driver's vehicle and driving conditions, driving and vehicle attributes are defined. The historical driving data are clustered and the class of the goal driver among clustered data is determined through classification. Eventually, the required travel time and energy consumption corresponding to historical speed profiles are evaluated and the time and/or energy efficient route along with the desired speed profile are determined. The proposed method is tested on a set of data gathered in the Warrigal project, which provides real vehicle state information. Since the consumed energy data are not available in this dataset, a detailed EV model is adopted to estimate the energy consumption. The obtained results verify the effectiveness of the proposed routing algorithm in locating the time and/or energy efficient routes.",

    "abstract": "This article studies semantic segmentation using 3D LiDAR data. Popular deep learning methods applied for this task require a large number of manual annotations to train the parameters. We propose a new method that makes full use of the advantages of traditional methods and deep learning methods via incorporating human domain knowledge into the neural network model to reduce the demand for large numbers of manual annotations and improve the training efficiency. We first pretrain a model with autogenerated samples from a rule-based classifier so that human knowledge can be propagated into the network. Based on the pretrained model, only a small set of annotations is required for further fine-tuning. Quantitative experiments show that the pretrained model achieves better performance than random initialization in almost all cases; furthermore, our method can achieve similar performance with fewer manual annotations.",

    "abstract": "Vision-based research for intelligent vehicles have traditionally focused on specific regions around a vehicle, such as a front looking camera for, e.g., lane estimation. Traffic scenes are complex and vital information could be lost in unobserved regions. This paper proposes a framework that uses four visual sensors for a full surround view of a vehicle in order to achieve an understanding of surrounding vehicle behaviors. The framework will assist the analysis of naturalistic driving studies by automating the task of data reduction of the observed trajectories. To this end, trajectories are estimated using a vehicle detector together with a multiperspective optimized tracker in each view. The trajectories are transformed to a common ground plane, where they are associated between perspectives and analyzed to reveal tendencies around the ego-vehicle. The system is tested on sequences from 2.5 h of drive on US highways. The multiperspective tracker is tested in each view as well as for the ability to associate vehicles bet-ween views with a 92% recall score. A case study of vehicles approaching from the rear shows certain patterns in behavior that could potentially influence the ego-vehicle.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a probabilistic method for realtime decision making and motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Our approach relies on the fact that driving on road networks implies apriori defined requirements that the motion planner should satisfy. Starting from an initial state of the vehicle, a map, the obstacles in the region of interest, and a goal region, we formulate the motion-planning problem as a nonlinear non-Gaussian estimation problem, which we solve using particle filtering. We assign probabilities to the generated trajectories according to their likelihood of obeying the driving requirements. Decision making and collision avoidance is naturally integrated in the approach. We develop a receding-horizon implementation and verify the method in simulated real road scenarios and in an experimental validation using a scaled mobile robot setup with car-like dynamics. The results show that the method generates dynamically feasible trajectories for a number of scenarios, such as collision avoidance, overtaking, and traffic-jam scenarios. In addition, the computation times and memory requirements indicate that the method is suitable for real-time implementation.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2022.3180337",
    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Autonomous driving technologies have received notable attention in the past decades. In autonomous driving systems, identifying a precise dynamical model for motion control is nontrivial due to the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty in vehicle dynamics. Recent efforts have resorted to machine learning techniques for building vehicle dynamical models, but the generalization ability and interpretability of existing methods still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a pure data-driven vehicle modeling approach based on deep neural networks with an interpretable Koopman operator. The main advantage of using the Koopman operator is to represent the nonlinear dynamics in a linear lifted feature space. In the proposed approach, a deep learning-based extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm is presented to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. A multi-step prediction loss function is used in the training process, enabling a long-term prediction capability. Furthermore, a data-driven model predictive controller with the learned Koopman model is designed for velocity profile tracking control of autonomous vehicles. Simulation results in a high-fidelity CarSim environment show that our approach outperforms previously developed traditional and advanced modeling methods. Velocity profile tracking tests of the autonomous vehicle are also performed in the CarSim environment. The results show that our approach has better tracking accuracy and higher computational efficiency than the model predictive control algorithms using a nonlinear model and a linear time-varying model.",

In this paper, we propose a unified framework for surround vehicle maneuver classification and motion prediction that exploits multiple cues, namely, the estimated motion of vehicles, an understanding of typical motion patterns of freeway traffic and intervehicle interaction. We report our results in terms of maneuver classification accuracy and mean and median absolute error of predicted trajectories against the ground truth for real traffic data collected using vehicle mounted sensors on freeways. An ablative analysis is performed to analyze the relative importance of each cue for trajectory prediction. Additionally, an analysis of execution time for the components of the framework is presented.

    "abstract": "Shadow detection and removal is an important task for on-road visual perception. However, effectively detecting and removing the shadows on the road to maintain illumination consistency remain challenging. Road shadows blur and change road features, greatly damaging the image quality and making further detection and tracking more difficult to implement. For example, detection could be mistaken due to incorrect identification of shadow boundaries. The adaptability and accuracy can be affected as well. To tackle the problems, this paper employs Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on color saliency space and gradient field to detect shadow. Nonlinear SVM classifier analyzes its color saliency space and gradient information, then reconstructs road shadow descriptor to distinguish shadowed regions. To remove the shadow, adaptive variable scale regional compensation operator is adopted. Following experiments verify the detection and removal method are feasible in the real world, and robust to many types of road conditions.",

    "abstract": "Extracting semantic information solely from automotive radar data is a relatively new topic in the radar community. We present a complete pipeline to obtain semantic information for each target measured by a network of radar sensors. Static and dynamic objects are treated in two separate branches: In the first branch, a convolutional neural network performs semantic segmentation on radar grid maps of the static environment. In the second branch, a novel neural network architecture is used for recurrent instance segmentation on radar point clouds of moving objects. The class probabilities assigned to each cell in the grid map are mapped back to the radar targets in this spatial region so that in a merging step the results from the two classifiers can be combined into one point cloud. In addition to a novel network structure for recurrent instance segmentation of point clouds, we present a new set of layers for radar grid maps which are beneficial for semantic segmentation tasks and we also develop a weighting scheme for the network's loss function to account for the data integration process in grid maps. We evaluate our approaches on large data sets and we display that they outperform previously proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "Efficient trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles in complex traffic scenarios is of interest both academically and in automotive industry. Time efficiency and safety are of key importance and here a two-step procedure is proposed. First, a convex optimization problem is solved, formulated as a support vector machine (SVM), in order to represent the surrounding environment of the ego vehicle and classify the search space as obstacles or obstacle free. This gives a reduced complexity search space and an A* algorithm is used in a state space lattice in 4 dimensions including position, heading angle and velocity for simultaneous path and velocity planning. Further, a heuristic derived from the SVM formulation is used in the A* search and a pruning technique is introduced to significantly improve search efficiency. Solutions from the proposed planner is compared to optimal solutions computed using optimal control techniques. Three traffic scenarios, a roundabout scenario and two complex takeover maneuvers, with multiple moving obstacles, are used to illustrate the general applicability of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "A key step to driver safety is to observe the driver's activities with the face being a key step in this process to extracting information such as head pose, blink rate, yawns, talking to passenger which can then help derive higher level information, such as distraction, drowsiness, intent, and where they are looking. In the context of driving safety, it is important for the system perform robust estimation under harsh lighting and occlusion but also be able to detect when the occlusion occurs so that information predicted from occluded parts of the face can be taken into account properly. This paper introduces the Occluded Stacked Hourglass, based on the work of original Stacked Hourglass network for body pose joint estimation, which is retrained to process a detected face window and output 68 occlusion heat maps, each corresponding to a facial landmark. Landmark location, occlusion levels and a refined face detection score, to reject false positives, are extracted from these heat maps. Using the facial landmark locations, features such as head pose and eye/mouth openness can be extracted to derive driver attention and activity. The system is evaluated for face detection, head pose, and occlusion estimation on various datasets in the wild, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and shows state-of-the-art results.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a hierarchical three-layer trajectory planning framework to realize real-time collision avoidance under complex driving conditions. This is mainly ascribed to the generation of a collision-free trajectory cluster based on the speed and the path re-planning. The upper-layer controller is to generate a reference quintic polynomial trajectory based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming by assuming mild speed and acceleration variations of the surrounding vehicles. The waypoints and time stamps can be obtained via the reference trajectory. When the assumption is invalid under complex driving conditions, the middle-layer controller would generate a Quadratic Programming-based trajectory cluster to assign different time stamps to each waypoint through time-based sampling methods. The lower-layer controller would be triggered to create a new feasible trajectory based on the path sampling if the collision avoidance requirements are not satisfied. The host vehicle will return to its original lane if no feasible time window is available to perform a lane change maneuver under the vehicle kinematics and lane change time/displacement constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified under various scenarios through comprehensive simulations.",

We developed a machine vision-based framework to classify driver's gaze into context rich zones of interest and model driver's gaze behavior by representing gaze dynamics over a time period using gaze accumulation, glance duration, and glance frequencies. As a use case, we explore the driver's gaze dynamic patterns during maneuvers executed in freeway driving, namely, left lane change maneuver, right lane change maneuver, and lane keeping. It is shown that condensing gaze dynamics into durations and frequencies leads to recurring patterns based on driver activities. Furthermore, modeling these patterns show predictive powers in maneuver detection up to a few hundred milliseconds a priori.",

This paper presents a novel instrument for pedestrian detection by combining stereo vision cameras with a thermal camera. A new dataset for vehicle applications is built from the test vehicle recorded data when driving on city roads. Data received from multiple cameras are aligned using trifocal tensor with pre-calibrated parameters. Candidates are generated from each image frame using sliding windows across multiple scales. A reconfigurable detector framework is proposed, in which feature extraction and classification are two separate stages. The input to the detector can be the color image, disparity map, thermal data, or any of their combinations. When applying to convolutional channel features, feature extraction utilizes the first three convolutional layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network cascaded with an AdaBoost classifier. The evaluation results show that it significantly outperforms the traditional histogram of oriented gradients features. The proposed pedestrian detector with multi-spectral cameras can achieve 9% log-average miss rate. The experimental dataset is made available at http://computing.wpi.edu/dataset.html.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, point cloud representations or Doppler spectrograms have been generated from short-range automotive radars for dynamic object detection and classification. In this work, we propose using inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images obtained from range compensated turning targets for the classification of different types of vehicles. We experimentally demonstrate that ISAR images of automotive targets provide rich features such as the dimensions, trajectory, and the number of wheels of the vehicles for classification. Additionally, we present a simulation framework for generating large volumes of realistic ISAR images of automotive targets at millimeter-wave frequencies for training classifiers. The model incorporates radar scattering phenomenology of commonly found vehicles along with range-Doppler-based clutter and receiver noise. The model is experimentally validated with measurement data gathered from an automotive radar. The images from the simulation database are subsequently classified using traditional machine learning techniques and deep neural networks based on transfer learning. We show that the ISAR images offer a classification accuracy above 90% and are robust to both noise and clutter.",

    "abstract": "The rapidly increasing connectedness of modern vehicles leads to new security challenges for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs), where some potential attackers can achieve unauthorized access to gain control of the vehicle by injecting malicious information into in-vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). Therefore, in this paper, a secure attribute-isolated communication architecture for an ICV, which introduces attributes into the ECUs to achieve authorized access among the ECU nodes is proposed. First, an analysis of the functional attributes of all of the in-vehicle ECUs in an intelligent connected environment and a division of the functional attributes of the ECUs into five classifications are performed. Second, based on the above-classified attributes, a secure attribute-isolated communication architecture is demonstrated. The ECUs have different access rights, allowing only the ECUs with the same functional attributes in the internal network of the vehicle to communicate. Then, it is proven that the proposed architecture can resist forgery and eavesdropping attacks under the random oracle model. Finally, the secure attribute-isolated communication architecture is constructed in a hardware environment and evaluated with an in-vehicle network simulator (IVNS). The evaluation results show that the average memory usage with 120 ECUs and 100 messages is below 40 MB and the bus load can be reduced to 18.96% using the proposed security architecture compared to the bus load of existing architectures. Therefore, the proposed secure attribute-isolated communication architecture solves the problem of the tradeoff between the security threat of unauthorized access and the high bus load of existing in-vehicle architectures.",

    "abstract": "An essential and challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is turning at mixed-flow intersections when they interact with motorized, non-motorized and pedestrian traffic simultaneously. In these situations, sensor measurement noise and blind zones create additional complexity in an already problematic environment. In order to make motion planning feasible in a multi-interaction environment with detection uncertainty feasible, this article proposes a hierarchical framework that divides the highly-related driving process into a decision, planning and action layer. The decision layer first employs a logit model combined with Bayes' theorem to make a discrete choice about whether to turn or not. Then, the plan layer initializes a local trajectory with selected waypoints considering the location of interacting objects based on a Bézier curve. Finally, feedback is used to adjust the vehicle's decision and trajectory plan when collision risks increase due to the unexpected behavior of other objects. Additionally, in order to consider sensor data noise and blind zones of AVs, an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) was used to estimate the status of sensory targets. The performance of the proposed model was compared with drivers' performance for the same turning scenarios at two mixed-flow intersections. The results show that the simulation produced human-like flexibility when planning trajectories in a multi-interaction environment. Moreover, the travel time of AVs did not show a statistically significant difference when compared with manually driven vehicles (MVs). Instead, the AVs actually performed better in terms of safety than the MVs.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2022.3153472",
    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the longitudinal control of vehicle platoons with a focus on external disturbances, parameter uncertainties, and communication failures. When vehicle platoons encounter vehicle to vehicle wireless communication failures, the preceding vehicle’s acceleration is unavailable, which degrades the performance of the system. However, the existing achievements can not be directly used to address the aforementioned three issues. To this end, a generalized extended state observer-based control (GESOBC) law is contrived. First, the parameter uncertainties and the external disturbances are together regarded as a lumped disturbance. Then, a generalized extended state observer is designed to estimate the lumped disturbance and the preceding vehicle’s acceleration, separately. Based on the estimation, a composite controller consisting of a state feedback control part and an estimation-based feedforward control part is developed. Furthermore, it is proved that the proposed GESOBC method can guarantee the exponentially bounded stability of the individual vehicle and the input to state string stability of the whole vehicle platoon. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.",

    "publication_date": "June 2018",
    "abstract": "The autonomous vehicle (AV) is expected to be an important “building block” of the future smart city. Recently, an AV-based public transportation system has been successfully developed to provide precise, effective, and intelligent public transportation services. For better quality of service, the system encourages market competition by accommodating multiple AV operators. To facilitate the pricing process, a pricing mechanism was developed but it can only process one service request each time. This can significantly impair the overall passenger admissibility, especially when there are many outstanding requests to be processed. In this paper, we redesign the pricing mechanism for handling multiple requests simultaneously. To do this, we formulate the key component of the mechanism, i.e., request-AV allocation, as a double combinatorial auction-based process. We construct a new winner determination problem that can accommodate requests of different AV service types. We also investigate its duality to devise an efficient service charge determination rule. We evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism and charging rule with extensive simulations. The results show that the mechanism can result in better social welfare than the original scheme. Moreover, we examine the computational time required and the percentage of successfully served passengers. The simulations demonstrate that the mechanism can make the AV public transportation system more practical.",

    "publication_date": "Dec. 2021",
    "abstract": "Haptic guidance in a shared steering assistance system has drawn significant attention in intelligent vehicle fields, owing to its mutual communication ability for vehicle control. By exerting continuous torque on the steering wheel, both the driver and support system can share lateral control of the vehicle. However, current haptic guidance steering systems demonstrate some deficiencies in assisting lane changing. This study explored a new steering interaction method, including the design and evaluation of an intention-based haptic shared steering system. Such an intention-based method can support both lane keeping and lane changing assistance, by detecting a driver's lane change intention. By using a deep learning-based method to model a driver's decision timing regarding lane crossing, an adaptive gain control method was proposed for realizing a steering control system. An intention consistency method was proposed to detect whether the driver and the system were acting towards the same target trajectories and to accurately capture the driver's intention. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to test the system performance. Participants were required to perform six trials with assistive methods and one trial without assistance. The results demonstrated that the supporting system decreased the lane departure risk in the lane keeping tasks and could support a fast and stable lane changing maneuver.",

    "abstract": "Before widespread automated driving, driver assistance systems become more common and can deliver safety benefits. This study focuses on current and future lane keeping assistance (LKA) systems and their potential safety effects by analysing real-world crash data and LKA's possibilities to prevent fatal passenger car crashes. The analysed data includes in-depth analysis of 364 fatal head-on and single-vehicle crashes in Finland. According to statistical analysis, 27% of these crashes could potentially have been prevented had currently available LKA been deployed. In this study, many issues are examined related to the lane markings' visibility, infrastructure, weather, and driver-related risks, which rationalise the results, compliment previous research, and highlight possibilities to increase the safety potential of LKA. Related to the lane markings' visibility, safety potential could be improved by allocating more resources to road maintenance and to snow clearance. Advanced LKA enabling exploiting digital lane markings could hypothetically almost double the safety potential as weather conditions or the visibility of lane markings would not restrict LKA's operation. While the driver is still in charge of driving tasks, driver-related risks are difficult to manage and the crashes caused intendedly or due to driver's attack of illness are not preventable by current LKA systems.",

The global framework covers the power distribution between the internal combustion engine and the electric machine(s) in order to minimize the fuel consumption. Current technologies allow the forecast of speed profile and road grade making predictive control a viable solution. The gears within the prediction model are assumed to be pre-calculated at a higher level and, therefore, only the torque split problem needs to be addressed by the energy management mechanism. Engine stop can improve fuel gain, which is even more noticeable for hybrid vehicles and hence, its inclusion is naturally considered in this study.

    "abstract": "Driving range is one of the main obstacles to the wide diffusion of electric vehicles. In order to overcome it without needing to increase battery size and price of the vehicle, one promising solution consists in leveraging advanced driver assistance systems to increase and master the driving range. This paper proposes model-based strategies to predict and optimize the energy consumption of a trip. Before the trip, an energy efficient route is suggested. During the trip a precise prediction of the current driving range is provided, and an optimal speed profile is computed to advise the driver. These strategies take into account the specific vehicle parameters, as well as the topology of the road network in which the vehicle operates, and the real-time traffic conditions. A macroscopic version of the energy consumption model of the electric vehicle is presented in order to use the aggregated real-time data available on typical maps web-services. The road network is modeled as a weighted directed graph adapted to the proposed energy consumption model. The energy driving range and the optimal route are finally obtained by means of a suitable optimal path search algorithm. For eco-driving, a different approach using an artificial neural network has been chosen to enable real-time implementation. As for the human-machine interface, the output of these strategies is finally suggested to the driver via a smartphone application. Experimental results show promising gains as compared to the existing approaches in predicting vehicle energy consumption, in suggesting an efficient route, and in providing eco-driving assistance.",

    "abstract": "This article concerns the open question of creating control policies of autonomous vehicles (AVs) that lead to courteous motion. The study is built on a two-agent interaction between two agents (M and H), where each agent plans its motion by optimizing a trade-off of goal fulfillment, safety, and courtesy losses. The paper has three contributions: First, the “double-blindness” issue in intent inference, i.e., inferring H's intent requires knowledge about H's inference of M's intent, is addressed. An empathetic intent inference algorithm is proposed, where H's intent, along with its inference of M's intent, are jointly inferred. Second, vehicle dynamics is explicitly incorporated into intent inference to acknowledge its influence on decision making in driving by the drivers' knowledge about dynamical properties of surrounding vehicles. Lastly, a courtesy loss that leverages intent inference is introduced. This loss measures the expected additional loss to H caused by M's motion from a baseline where M behaves rationally and in favor of H. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate that (1) joint inference and knowledge about vehicle dynamics are important to intent decoding and motion planning, and (2) the proposed courtesy definition leads to more rational motions than those from an existing definition.",

    "abstract": "Mobile robot autonomous path planning is an essential factor for its wide deployment in real-world applications. Conventional sampling-based algorithms have gained tremendous success in the path planning field, but they usually take much time to find the optimal solution so that the planning quality (evaluated with time cost and path length) cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, based on Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) and the family of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) schemes, we propose the GMR-RRT* algorithm to achieve fast path planning for mobile robots. The proposed GMR-RRT* consists of learning navigation behaviors from human demonstrations and planning a high-quality path for the robot. Using the GMR, the key features of human demonstrations are captured to form a probability density distribution of the human trajectory in the current environment. This distribution is further utilized to guide the RRT scheme’s sampling process to generate a feasible path in the current environment quickly. We test the proposed GMR-RRT* in different environments, comparing it with three state-of-the-art sampling-based algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the GMR-RRT* algorithm can achieve better performance in terms of time cost, memory usage, and path length.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has been forming the central piece of various types of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) network for trusted data exchange. Recently, permissioned blockchains garner particular attention thanks to their improved scalability and diverse needs from different organizations. One representative example of permissioned blockchain is Hyperledger Fabric (“Fabric”). Due to its unique execute-order procedure, there is a critical need for a client to select an optimal number of peers. The interesting problem that this paper targets to address is the tradeoff in the number of peers: a too large number will degrade scalability while a too small number will make the network vulnerable to faulty nodes. This optimization issue gets especially challenging in V2X networks due to mobility of nodes: a transaction must be executed, and the associated block must be committed before the vehicle leaves a network. To this end, this paper proposes a mechanism for selecting an optimal set of peers based on reinforcement learning (RL) to keep a Fabric-empowered V2X network impervious to dynamicity due to mobility. We model the RL as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. The results demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "Speed advisory systems have been proposed for connected vehicles in order to minimize energy consumption over a planned route. However, for their practical diffusion, these systems must adequately take into account the presence of preceding vehicles. In this paper, a safe- and eco-driving control system is proposed for connected and automated vehicles to accelerate or decelerate optimally while guaranteeing vehicle safety constraints. We define minimum intervehicle distance and maximum road speed limit as state constraints, and formulate an optimal control problem minimizing the energy consumption. Then, an analytical state-constrained solution is derived for real-time use. A feasible range of terminal conditions is established, and such conditions are adjusted to guarantee the existence of the analytical solution. The proposed system is evaluated through simulation for various driving scenarios of the preceding vehicle. Results show that it can significantly reduce energy consumption and also avoid collision without increasing trip time. Moreover, the proposed system can serve as an energy-efficient advanced cruise control by setting a short prediction horizon.",

    "abstract": "A pre-crash detection and warning system in a host vehicle needs to accurately determine the position of each remote vehicle in its vicinity and the context of the driving environment. ADAS (Advanced driver-assistance systems) have extensively used camera radar and LIDAR for automatic detection of vehicles, pedestrians and other road users and their behaviors. However, these vehicle-resident sensors have short operation ranges and require objects to be within the line-of-sight. V2V communication has emerged to be a promising technology to augment vehicle-resident sensors with extended ability of an overall vehicle safety system by addressing a broader range of crash scenarios with improved warning timing. In this paper we present an intelligent system, Geo+NN, developed using the synergy of neural network and geometric modeling. We extract the key geometric features using an analytic geometric model and use them as input to a neural network that is trained on real-world V2V signals to detect and predict remote vehicles’ positions. Geo+NN system is evaluated on V2V communication data recorded during real-world driving trips by vehicles installed with DSRC devices. Experimental results show that Geo+NN has the capabilities of effectively detecting and predicting remote vehicles within the context of 8 different positions.",

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, the number of road traffic deaths have been continuously increasing since last few years though the rate of deaths relative to world's population has stabilized in recent years. As per the survey of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving is a leading factor in road accidents. In this paper, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach for detecting and classifying the driver distraction. In the development of safety features for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, the algorithm not only has to be accurate but also efficient in terms of memory and speed. Hence, we focused on developing computationally efficient CNN while maintaining good accuracy. We propose a new architecture named as mobileVGG based on depthwise separable convolutions. We evaluate results of the proposed network on the American University in Cairo (AUC) distracted driver detection dataset as well as Statefarm's dataset on Kaggle and compare the performance with state-of-the-art CNN architectures from literature. Our proposed mobileVGG architecture with just 2.2M parameters outperforms earlier approaches while achieving 95.24% and 99.75% accuracy on AUC and Statefarm's dataset respectively with less computational complexity and memory requirement.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel real-time integrated unsupervised learning framework for lane detection, tracking, and road surface marking detection and recognition using live feed from a camera mounted on the dashboard of a moving vehicle. Accurate and automated lane and road surface marking detection and recognition from cameras play an important role in intelligent vehicles. It helps increase driving safety in advanced driver assistant systems and enhance global localization and path planning in autonomous driving vehicles. Map building and updation can also benefit from automated detection of lanes and road surface markings. In our framework, we propose a spatio-temporal incremental clustering algorithm coupled with curve-fitting for simultaneously detecting lanes and road surface markings. The clusters that do not represent the lanes are further processed using Grassmann manifold learning to accurately recognize the road surface markings. Our framework is independent of the number and type of lanes, be it continuous, non-continuous, straight, or curved. Moreover, the framework works for all types, sizes, and orientations of road surface markings. It is only limited by the type of road surface markings present in the training data. We have measured the performance of our framework on state-of-the-art datasets.",

Meanwhile, with the coordination of the autonomous intersections, autonomous vehicles on any approaching lane are able to turn onto any downstream lane, expecting that driving in such a road system, autonomous vehicles can reach their destinations without any on-road lane changes, and high traffic efficiency will be achieved as well as great traffic safety. To draw the picture in detail, this paper designs a signal-free autonomous intersection with all-direction turn lanes (ADTL) under the environment of autonomous vehicles, and proposes a conflict-avoidance-based approach to coordinate all approaching vehicles in different directions. Communicating with the approaching autonomous vehicles and utilizing the approach, the autonomous ADTL intersection is able to coordinate the approaching vehicles in all directions and guide them to safely and efficiently pass through the intersection. Two simulation scenarios are conducted in a road network with an isolated intersection composed of four three-lane arms. One scenario validates the collision-free design of the system, and the other shows that the designed ADTL intersection outperforms the conventional signal controlled intersection in terms of traffic efficiency, and is potentially better than the autonomous intersection with specific-direction turn lanes. The autonomous ADTL intersection can be an important basis for designing a future autonomous urban road traffic system.",

    "abstract": "Driving in a dynamic, multi-agent, and complex urban environment is a difficult task requiring a complex decision-making policy. The learning of such a policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire environment. Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle’s environment as images have become a popular choice. Still, they are quite high-dimensional, limiting their use in data-hungry approaches such as reinforcement learning. In this article, we propose to learn a low-dimensional and rich latent representation of the environment by leveraging the knowledge of relevant semantic factors. To do this, we train an encoder-decoder deep neural network to predict multiple application-relevant factors such as the trajectories of other agents and the ego car. Furthermore, we propose a hazard signal based on other vehicles’ future trajectories and the planned route which is used in conjunction with the learned latent representation as input to a down-stream policy. We demonstrate that using the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network results in a more informative representation than a standard single-head model. In particular, the proposed representation learning and the hazard signal help reinforcement learning to learn faster, with increased performance and less data than baseline methods.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2022.3165178",
    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Reinforcementlearning holds the promise of allowing autonomous vehicles to learn complex decision making behaviors through interacting with other traffic participants. However, many real-world driving tasks involve unpredictable perception errors or measurement noises which may mislead an autonomous vehicle into making unsafe decisions, even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these risks, to ensure safety under perception uncertainty, autonomous vehicles are required to be able to cope with the worst case observation perturbations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel observation adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust lane change decision making of autonomous vehicles. A constrained observation-robust Markov decision process is presented to model lane change decision making behaviors of autonomous vehicles under policy constraints and observation uncertainties. Meanwhile, a black-box attack technique based on Bayesian optimization is implemented to approximate the optimal adversarial observation perturbations efficiently. Furthermore, a constrained observation-robust actor-critic algorithm is advanced to optimize autonomous driving lane change policies while keeping the variations of the policies attacked by the optimal adversarial observation perturbations within bounds. Finally, the robust lane change decision making approach is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows based on different densities. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance the performance of an autonomous vehicle but also improve the robustness of lane change policies against adversarial observation perturbations.",

One can view an automated vehicle as having Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, being able to self-drive, sense its surroundings, recognise objects in its vicinity, and perform reasoning and decision-making. Rather than being stand alone, we examine the need for automated vehicles to cooperate and interact within their socio-cyber-physical environments, including the problems cooperation will solve, but also the issues and challenges. We review current work in cooperation for automated vehicles, based on selected examples from the literature. We conclude noting the need for the ability to behave cooperatively as a form of social-AI capability for automated vehicles, beyond sensing the immediate environment and beyond the underlying networking technology.",

    "publication_date": "June 2020",
    "abstract": "Vehicle platooning, a coordinated vehicle movement strategy, has been proposed to address a range of current transport challenges such as traffic congestion, road safety, energy consumption and pollution. While the current literature mainly focuses on platoon control strategies and intra-platoon communication, comparatively little work is done on how to form these platoons. Literature assumes platoon formation by tail merge which is sufficient only for planned formation on a ramp or at a ramp-highway junction. In this article we study the impact of three different merge operations, namely front, middle, and tail merge. The efficiency of these operations is analyzed under different scenarios, varying the vehicles speed adjustment strategy, traffic density, and the density of mergeable vehicles. The impact of the merge operations is represented in terms of merge time, merge distance, average traffic speed, and merge success rate. Our experiments show that in an ideal no traffic scenario, the middle merge is costlier in terms of merge time for the same merge distance whereas in the presence of traffic middle merge helps is quick platoon formation on an average in a higher traffic density in particular. This insight should provide a more flexible toolkit for planning a platoon formation.",

    "abstract": "Motion planning is a core technique for autonomous driving. Nowadays, there still exists a lot of challenges in motion planning for autonomous driving in complicated environments due to: 1) the need of both spatial and temporal planning in highly dynamic environments; 2) nonlinear vehicle dynamic models and non-convex collision avoidance constraints; and 3) the need of high computation efficiency for real-time implementation. Iterative linear quadratic regulator (ILQR) is an algorithm to solve the optimal control problem with nonlinear system very efficiently. However, it can not deal with constraints. In this paper, the constrained iterative LQR (CILQR) is proposed to efficiently solve the optimal control problem with nonlinear system dynamics and general form of constraints. An autonomous driving motion planning problem is then formulated and solved using CILQR. Simulation case studies show the capability of the CILQR algorithm to solve these kind of problems and the computation efficiency of CILQR is shown to be much higher than the standard SQP solver.",

The industry has also picked upon the rising interest for PTW oriented services using crowdsourcing and smartphones. However, current navigation or other travel information services are not at all customized to the needs of PTWs, which are systematically being neglected from the target group. To address the needs of this diverse mode, one should first be able to identify PTWs from the rest of the vehicles. The aim of the specific study is to develop models to reveal the contributing factors which are related to the identification of PTWs using solely smartphone sensors' data and tree-based machine learning approaches. To boost the accuracy of the identification task, popular feature selection algorithms and meta-modeling strategies are implemented and evaluated. Additionally, in order to deal with the unbalanced dataset different oversampling techniques are examined. Results show that high accuracy models can be developed for the specific classification problem with the proper feature representation.",

We identify a need for pervasive cyclist identification to improve situational awareness and propose as a solution the concept of using AV-mounted Bluetooth receivers for identifying and localizing a pedalcyclist's “beaconing” Bluetooth device, e.g., a preexisting, low-cost performance monitoring system. This method estimates the distance-to-bicycle from the receivers’ Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). Experimental results prove its feasibility for coarse pedalcyclist localization. Such a system may augment contemporary vision-based detection systems, thereby improving detection resilience and safety, particularly in dark or poor weather conditions.",

Our method exploits two model realizations, on the one hand, the famous bicycle model is used to estimate the longitudinal/lateral tire-ground forces at each axle. On the other hand, the hoverboard model is introduced to compute analogous forces at the left and right virtual tires. The algorithm is capable to correctly split the tire-ground forces given by both models without the necessity of a tire representation, the longitudinal slip, and the side-slip angles. The precise tire-ground forces computation at each tire position is made with a closed-loop observer scheme using a constrained extended Kalman filter. The results are validated with three tests: two slaloms, the first one performing within the linear tire operation domain and during the second test the tires are acting under the non-linear saturated region, and the third test is a circle maneuver with constant steering and longitudinal acceleration.",

    "abstract": "There is currently a huge interest around autonomous vehicles from both industry and academia. This is mainly due to recent advances in machine learning and deep learning, allowing the development of promising methods for autonomous driving. The gap toward full autonomy is incrementally being reduced with essentially three main existing approaches. First, Modular systems that combine a pipeline of methods with each solving one specific sub-task of driving. Second, Direct Perception techniques that directly estimate affordances (car orientation, distances between lane borders, etc) used to compute control commands through a simple logic. Finally, end-to-end frameworks that automatically map raw sensor data to actuation values. The objective of this paper is to review some recent works focusing on end-to-end deep learning models for lane stable driving, as well as some publicly available real world datasets and open-source simulators that enable the development and evaluation of such methods.",

    "publication_date": "Sept. 2022",
    "abstract": "Neural networks are currently suggested to be implemented in several different driving functions of autonomous vehicles. While showing promising results the drawback lies in the difficulty of safety verification and ensuring operation as intended. The aim of this paper is to increase safety when using neural networks, by proposing a monitoring framework based on novelty estimation of incoming driving data. The idea is to use unsupervised instance discrimination to learn a similarity measure across ego-vehicle camera images. By estimating a von Mises-Fisher distribution of \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">expected</i>\n ego-camera images they can be compared with \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">unexpected</i>\n novel images. A novelty measurement is inferred through the likelihood of test frames belonging to the expected distribution. The suggested method provides competitive results to several other novelty or anomaly detection algorithms on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. It also shows promising results on real world driving scenarios by distinguishing novel driving scenes from the training data of BDD100 k. Applied on the identical training-test data split, the method is also able to predict the performance profile of a segmentation network. Finally, examples are provided on how this method can be extended to find novel segments in images.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the control problem for leader-following (LF) vehicle platoons with a constant-spacing policy, where the information of the leader is broadcast to each follower via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) subject to varied communication ranges. According to the connectivity status between the leader and each follower, platoon control is modeled as a switched platoon control system with a connectivity-status-matrix-dependent controller. By using switched system theory, a series of sufficient conditions are obtained as a criteria for the stability analysis and control synthesis of the LF platoon. Based on the obtained conditions, a useful platoon control algorithm is proposed. For each obtained connectivity-status-matrix-dependent controller, the string stability and a zero steady-state spacing error can be guaranteed by additional conditions. Numerical simulations and experiments with laboratory-scale Arduino cars are conducted to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Obstacle detection and tracking is an important research topic in computer vision with a number of practical applications. Though an ample amount of research has been done in this domain, implementing automatic obstacle detection and tracking in real time is still a big challenge. To address this issue, we propose a fast and robust obstacle detection and tracking approach by integrating an adaptive obstacle detection strategy within a kernelized correlation filter (KCF) framework in this paper. A suitable salient object detection method autoinitializes the KCF tracker for this purpose. Moreover, an adaptive obstacle detection strategy is proposed to refine the location and boundary of the object when the confidence value of the tracker drops below a predefined threshold. In addition, a reliable postprocessing technique is implemented to accurately localize the obstacle from a saliency map recovered from the search region. The proposed approach has been extensively tested through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a number of challenging datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of tracking speed and accuracy.",

    "publication_date": "June 2019",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, due to the fact that motor efficiency is strictly related to the diminution of emissions, researchers pay much attention to find a robust and efficient motor control technique for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In this study, an optimal type-2 fuzzy fractional proportional plus integral derivative (IT2FOFP+ID) controller is applied to solve the throttle position and speed control problem of the HEVs. It is undeniable that the performance and effectiveness of the fuzzy-based proportionalintegral-derivative (PID) controllers are dependent on its gains' value. Hence, a novel improved heuristic technique, called IJAYA algorithm, is employed for the online tuning of the coefficients embedded in the specific controller structure. In contrast with the classical control methodologies that suffer from the lack of the selfregulating feature, the established controller has been adjusted online automatically. As another advantage of this control strategy, it is a model-free scheme and does not need the mathematical computation to identify the system model. To appraise the supremacy of the optimal IT2FOFP+ID controller than the other prevalent methodologies, a highly nonlinear EV model is utilized as a case study. In addition, the usefulness and robustness of the proposed method are tested by the experimental data, the EPA New York City Cycle. In the end, the new time-varying proposed technique is validated and implemented in hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation based on OPAL-RT to study the feasibility of the designed IT2FP+ID controller with check outcomes on a physical platform.",

First, an action-conditioned ensemble model with the capability of uncertainty assessment is established as the environment model. Then, a novel uncertainty-aware model-based RL method is developed based on the adaptive truncation approach, providing virtual interactions between the agent and environment model, and improving RL’s learning efficiency and performance. The proposed method is then implemented in end-to-end autonomous vehicle control tasks, validated and compared with state-of-the-art methods under various driving scenarios. Validation results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the model-free RL approach with respect to learning efficiency, and model-based approach with respect to both efficiency and performance, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "The explosive growth of massive data captured by various sensors on modern vehicles has impelled the deployment of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) accelerators for the research and development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Although the advent of cross-platform programming framework such as Open Computing Language (OpenCL) facilitates the programmability of ADAS applications on heterogeneous devices, the performance portability is still vulnerable and subject to different hardware implementations by the heterogeneous manufacturers. With this issue in mind, in this article we propose a detailed procedure that helps guide the performance optimisation of parallelized ADAS applications in an FPGA-GPU combined heterogeneous system. Taking two different lane detection applications as case studies, we provide one intra-accelerator and two interaccelerator optimisation methods, as well as both FPGA-specific and application-oriented optimisation strategies, to boost the program runtime performance. Experiment results on a heterogeneous platform with COTS FPGA and GPU components reveal that the optimal designs generated from the procedure can improve the runtime performance of the two applications by an average of 109.21% and 83.48% over the native parallel implementations, respectively.",

    "abstract": "With the evolution of self-driving cars, autonomous racing series like Roborace and the Indy Autonomous Challenge are rapidly attracting growing attention. Researchers participating in these competitions hope to subsequently transfer their developed functionality to passenger vehicles, in order to improve self-driving technology for reasons of safety, and due to environmental and social benefits. The race track has the advantage of being a safe environment where challenging situations for the algorithms are permanently created. To achieve minimum lap times on the race track, it is important to gather and process information about external influences including, e.g., the position of other cars and the friction potential between the road and the tires. Furthermore, the predicted behavior of the ego-car's propulsion system is crucial for leveraging the available energy as efficiently as possible. In this paper, we therefore present an optimization-based velocity planner, mathematically formulated as a multi-parametric Sequential Quadratic Problem (mpSQP). This planner can handle a spatially and temporally varying friction coefficient, and transfer a race Energy Strategy (ES) to the road. It further handles the velocity-profile-generation task for performance and emergency trajectories in real time on the vehicle's Electronic Control Unit (ECU).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel accurate method for dead-reckoning of wheeled vehicles based only on an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). In the context of intelligent vehicles, robust and accurate dead-reckoning based on the IMU may prove useful to correlate feeds from imaging sensors, to safely navigate through obstructions, or for safe emergency stops in the extreme case of exteroceptive sensors failure. The key components of the method are the Kalman filter and the use of deep neural networks to dynamically adapt the noise parameters of the filter. The method is tested on the KITTI odometry dataset, and our dead-reckoning inertial method based only on the IMU accurately estimates 3D position, velocity, orientation of the vehicle and self-calibrates the IMU biases. We achieve on average a 1.10% translational error and the algorithm competes with top-ranked methods which, by contrast, use LiDAR or stereo vision.",

    "abstract": "Any vehicle needs to be aware of its localization, destination, and neighboring vehicles' state information for collision free navigation. A centralized controller computes controls for cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) vehicles based on the assumed behavior of manually driven vehicles (MDVs) in a mixed vehicle scenario. The assumed behavior of the MDVs may be different from the actual behavior, which gives rise to a model mismatch. The use of erroneous localization information can generate erroneous controls. The presence of a model mismatch and the use of erroneous controls could potentially result into collisions. A controller robust to issues such as localization errors and model mismatches is thus required. This paper proposes a robust model predictive controller, which accounts for localization errors and mitigates model mismatches. Future control values computed by the centralized controller are shared with CACC vehicles and are stored in a buffer. Due to large localization errors or model mismatches when control computations are infeasible, control values from the buffer are used. Simulation results show that the proposed robust controller with buffer can avoid almost the same number of collisions in a scenario impacted by localization errors as that in a scenario with no localization errors despite model mismatch.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) have been deployed in various working environments. Human-AGV coexisting environments introduce many challenges into the motion planning procedure. The planner should be smart enough to guide the AGV to move safely and smoothly. Besides, the efficiency of the planner is essential for real-time response. Risk-based motion planning algorithms consider the risk of collision with dynamic and static obstacles to deal with planning problems in human-AGV coexisting environments. However, their performance needs to be further improved. The bidirectional search sampling strategy is widely used to obtain real-time response capability. However, when considering kinodynamic constraints, the bidirectional search sampling strategy needs to solve the two-point boundary value problem (TBVP), which is not always solvable for all kinds of kinodynamic constraints. To achieve efficient AGV navigation in the environment with pedestrians, we propose a risk-based algorithm with a bidirectional search sampling strategy, namely bidirectional Risk-RRT (Bi-Risk-RRT). Additionally, by using the other direction as a heuristic, Bi-Risk-RRT bypasses TBVP and retains the advantages of the bidirectional search sampling strategy. The simulation experiments are conducted in various challenging environments, and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

    "publication_date": "June 2020",
    "abstract": "Human Occupied Vehicle (HOV) is one of main tools to investigate submarine resources and carry out some underwater operations, and it can serve as a base for divers when they execute underwater activities. Therefore, the research on HOV is extremely significant. Aiming at the drive saturation (thrust overrun) problem of tracking control which is one of the main research directions, a hybrid control strategy based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization-model predictive control (QPSO-MPC) and adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) is put forward for “Jiaolong” HOV. The hybrid control strategy includes a QPSOMPC-based kinematic controller and an ASMC-based dynamic controller. The kinematic controller transforms the position error into the virtual desired speed. Then the error between the desired speed and real speed is used as the input for the dynamic controller. Through the design of S sliding manifold and dynamic control law, the thrusts of 4 DOF are obtained. The thrusts are distributed to eight thrusters in accordance with thrusters' configuration of “Jiaolong” HOV. So that HOV can be driven to reach and track the known reference trajectory. The innovation of this hybrid control strategy is it takes into account the limited speed for HOV. The constraints on speed and speed increment are added in the optimization part of the kinematic controller. A simple trajectory generator designed by QPSO-MPC is presented with obstacle avoidance behavior. Compared with backstepping control and bioinspired backstepping control, the proposed strategy can deal with the speed jump phenomenon and the drive saturation (thrust overrun) caused by exceeded speed variation. From the simulation results, the hybrid strategy is able to achieve stable and accurate tracking control under the condition of satisfying the physical constraints (speed and thrust constraints). And the trajectory generator is verified to be capable of trajectory planning with obstacle avoidance behavior.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles are aimed to reduce accidents and traffic congestion. Since hybrid electric vehicles offer feasible solutions to reduce energy consumption and emission to the environment, it is expected that autonomous vehicles will be powered through a hybrid electric system compared to other alternatives. In this paper, a hybrid electric autonomous vehicle is studied under significant amount of uncertainty and ambiguity in the road environment and driver behavior. A Type 1 fuzzy logic controller is constructed here to address the uncertainties of driving conditions. The design involves building an intelligent energy management system for the hybrid electric autonomous vehicle. We have also examined the potentials of the Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic control, especially for energy consumption management. Two simulations are implemented, to demonstrate that the intelligent system, proposed trough Type 1 and Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic control, decreases the fuel usage of the vehicle from 6.74 to 6.58 L/100km, respectively. It is also demonstrated that the Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic controller saves more battery life compared to the Type-1 when the vehicle works under uncertain and ambiguous road conditions. Finally, Interval Type-2 fuzzy logic controller facilitates a reduction of carbon footprint in the autonomous vehicle as desired by the automotive industry stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Today the automotive industry faces a robust trend toward assisted and automated driving. The technology to accomplish this ambition has evolved rapidly over the last few years, and yet there are still alot of algorithmical challenges left to make an automation of the driving task a safe and comfortable experience. One of the main remaining challenges is the comprehension of the current traffic situation and the anticipation of all traffic participants' future driving behavior, which is needed for the technical system to obtain situation awareness: an indispensable foundation for successful decision-making. In this paper, a prediction framework is presented that is able to infer a driver's maneuver intention. This is achieved via a hybrid Bayesian network whose hidden layers represent a driver's lane contentedness. A pre-training of the network's parameters with simulated data provides for human interpretable parameters even after running the expectation maximization algorithm based on data gathered on German highways. Moreover, the future driving path of any traffic participant is predicted by solving an optimal control problem, whereby the parameters of the optimal control formulation are found via inverse reinforcement learning.",

Therefore, we propose a shared authority mode connecting the automated and manual driving modes and a method for transferring control authority using haptic shared control to achieve smooth transfer. The results of driving simulation experiments demonstrate that the instability in the steering angular velocity originally present during control transfer is significantly improved by introducing our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Visible light communication could be an interesting complement to the IEEE 802.11p-based vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems that are sensitive to interferences and delays in dense traffic scenarios such as platooning. Visible light could also provide a redundant distance measure that is crucial for path control in this application. In this paper, a system called visible light communication rangefinder and performing simultaneously vehicle-to-vehicle communication and range-finding using the headlamps and taillights is proposed for the first time. By exchanging a clock signal contained in Manchester-encoded signals, both the following and leading vehicles can share information and estimate their inter-distance through phase-shift measurement. The system is first presented theoretically and it is shown in particular that the Doppler effect has no significant impact on both functions. Then, it is modeled and validated using Simulink. Finally, both the range-finding and communication function are validated experimentally. The range-finding function is functional up to 25 m, and has a resolution of around 24 cm at 10 m, whereas the communication function provides a 500 kbps link with a BER below 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n up to 30 m.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (MMW) radar sensors are considered key components of autonomous vehicles. Because of the performance degeneration of cameras and lidars under inclement weather conditions, robust autonomy must rely on radar sensors to perform target detection and classification. Unlike basic target classifier methods in literature that make use of target velocity, the proposed approach is far more comprehensive and can be applied to targets with zero-Doppler. Depending on the radar type and target range, this paper presents four target classification models based on four different types of radar data: statistical RCS, distributed (time-domain) RCS, range-azimuth angle radar images and 3D radar images. The classification models are implemented by machine learning approaches artificial neural network (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with a comprehensive simulated dataset. Good classification accuracies are demonstrated, and the proposed model is validated with measured data. Different radar target classification approaches are compared, which clearly reveals the trade-off between classification performance and system complexity. The proposed radar target classification methods can be applied effectively to both static and dynamic targets, at near or far ranges, using traditional or imaging radars, resulting in improved safety for autonomous vehicles in a wide variety of complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is one the most prominent air traffic surveillance technologies that emerged in recent years. It can be used not only as a complement to existing radar-based technologies to locate aircraft, but also as a replacement in areas without radar coverage. However, a major flaw in the deployment of this technology is its reliance on clear-text, open broadcast of messages, which makes it vulnerable to attackers. In this paper, we propose ADS-Bsec, a holistic framework that solves the root cause of ADS-B problems by enforcing the much needed authenticity and integrity in ADS-B messages. It does so without changing the message format, and along with a proper key exchange mechanism. In addition, our framework also leverages results from radio-location and risk-adaptive techniques in order to prevent attacks targeting ADS-B. An important characteristic of our framework is that it was mostly implemented using a test bed with actual prototype radios, which mimics as much as possible real flight conditions. As a result, our framework is a promising approach for integrating ADS-B to NextGen infrastructure in a secure and affordable fashion.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Predictive cruise control functions designed to reduce the energy consumption of intelligent and automated vehicles require an accurate prediction of the upcoming traffic situation in general and the preceding vehicle in particular. This article presents the implementation of prediction models which do not rely on explicit information of the entire preceding vehicle queue. Using this assumption, prediction algorithms based on Conditional Linear Gauss (CLG) models and Deep Neural Network (DNNs) were trained using real-world measurements in an urban setting. The training was conducted with 6.6 hours of driving data specifically collected for this study. The results show that both approaches can provide accurate estimates of a preceding vehicle’s motion. For the CLG models, a queue-estimation logic was implemented to improve the prediction accuracy. The most accurate prediction could be obtained when DNNs are set up with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, capable of modeling time dependencies. The results also show that accurate short and mid term predictions of a vehicle’s trajectory can be made based primarily on sensor data, even when no or only little data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is available.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles are complex systems that are challenging to test and debug. A requirements-driven approach to the development process can decrease the resources required to design and test these systems, while simultaneously increasing the reliability. We present a testing framework that uses signal temporal logic (STL), which is a precise and unambiguous requirements language. Our framework evaluates test cases against the STL formulae and additionally uses the requirements to automatically identify test cases that fail to satisfy the requirements. One of the key features of our tool is the support for machine learning (ML) components in the system design, such as deep neural networks. The framework allows evaluation of the control algorithms, including the ML components, and it also includes models of CCD camera, lidar, and radar sensors, as well as the vehicle environment. We use multiple methods to generate test cases, including covering arrays, which is an efficient method to search discrete variable spaces. The resulting test cases can be used to debug the controller design by identifying controller behaviors that do not satisfy requirements. The test cases can also enhance the testing phase of development by identifying critical corner cases that correspond to the limits of the system's allowed behaviors. We present STL requirements for an autonomous vehicle system, which capture both component-level and system-level behaviors. Additionally, we present three driving scenarios and demonstrate how our requirements-driven testing framework can be used to identify critical system behaviors, which can be used to support the development process.",

    "publication_date": "June 2018",
    "abstract": "Accurate and continuous positioning in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) deprived urban areas is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile mapping systems. To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo visual-inertial odometry approach using a multistate constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF). In contrast with the conventional MSCKF, in which an inertial navigation system (INS) propagates the vehicle motion, and then the propagation is corrected by measurements of salient features extracted from images of a single camera, we update the propagation with observations extracted from images of a stereo pair of cameras. This way, additional constraints across the stereo pairs of images are exploited to improve the pose estimation. Experimental results on several KITTI datasets show that the stereo MSCKF outperforms the mono one achieving an average positioning error of 0.9% of the trajectory length compared to 1.3% for the mono approach and 2.5% for INS-only integration. These results show that visual-inertial odometry has a promising potential for vehicle positioning in short periods of GNSS signal outage.",

    "abstract": "Electric vehicle adoption has accelerated globally, necessitating the development of an efficient charging technology. Static and partially dynamic charging are currently in use, but such types of charging reduce vehicles’ ability to stand charge, contributing to range anxiety. Dynamic charging of electric vehicles will be a promising technology in the near future, allowing an electric vehicle to charge by itself while in motion. However, assessing the security risks before enabling dynamic charging is mandatory, with authentication being a necessary step. Hence, a protocol suite EV-Auth is proposed for communicating entities in a dynamic charging system capable of mutual authentication and session key computation. To achieve practical capabilities, EV-Auth is built using lightweight cryptographic primitives. Additionally, it includes a unique feature known as seamless electric vehicle handover. The security of the proposed protocol suite is assessed both informally and formally using random oracle model and scyther tool. The performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol suite satisfies the communication and computation time requirements.",

    "abstract": "In this article, a new method is presented for simultaneous vehicle detection and disparity estimation from the blended multiple-view image. The multiple-view image is created by blending left and right images from a stereo camera. This blended image can implicitly encode the appearance and view disparity of an object in a single image, which provides clues for detection and disparity estimation. Since a single object may have multiple overlaid correspondence in a blended image, the detection task is formulated as finding a group of associated bounding boxes with similar appearances. The distances between the associated bounding boxes can be used to estimate the disparity of the object. The proposed method has following benefits: 1) The detection and disparity estimation tasks can be accomplished using a single input image; 2) Even the task is more complex than the popular detection task, the increase in computation cost is negligible; 3) Very competitive detection and disparity estimation accuracy is obtained, even the detection is performed on the blended image which is unfriendly to human vision. The experiment is conducted using KITTI stereo subset and very promising result has been observed.",

    "abstract": "This study compares Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) design in car-following scenarios. A first-order system is used as the Control-Oriented Model (COM) to approximate the acceleration command dynamics of a vehicle. Based on the equations of the control system and the multi-objective cost function, we train a DRL policy using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and solve the MPC problem via Interior-Point Optimization (IPO). Simulation results for the episode costs show that, when there are no modeling errors and the testing inputs are within the training data range, the DRL solution is equivalent to MPC with a sufficiently long prediction horizon. Particularly, the DRL episode cost is only 5.8% higher than the benchmark optimal control solution provided by optimizing the entire episode via IPO. The DRL control performance degrades when the testing inputs are outside the training data range, indicating inadequate machine learning generalization. When there are modeling errors due to control delay, disturbances, and/or testing with a High-Fidelity Model (HFM) of the vehicle, the DRL-trained policy performs better when the modeling errors are large while having similar performances as MPC when the modeling errors are small.",

The previous paper has introduced the design of a nonlinear Luenberger observer to simultaneously estimate both the motorcycle lateral dynamics and the rider action.

This paper proposes a recognition method for LIDARs based on only a few detection planes. This method is useful especially in the case when the angular resolution of the scan is sufficient, but in the vertical direction the planes are far from each other. We use Fourier descriptor to characterize a scan plane and Convolutional Neural Network for classification. Our method exploits both time varying shape information and contours from multiple scan planes if available. The method performs at least as well as the state of the art algorithms in case of near field, and it also expands the detection range.

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle safety driving requires many vision tasks, such as road segmentation, lane mark detection, and vehicle recognition by frontal cameras. However, all these tasks can suffer due to drastic changes of weather and illumination. To make vision a more robust function in driving, as it is for human drivers, this study models a spectrum of weather and illuminations visible in road environments. We implement big-data mining on naturalistic driving videos through four seasons to understand the influence of weather and illumination. Weather sensitive regions are sampled as image features to describe the illumination models qualitatively and quantitatively. To understand how many distinct weather and illumination types exist for vision tasks, clustering is performed by unsupervised learning on all video samples. Typical views of a spectrum of weather and illumination conditions are generated using K-means clustering of feature distributions; we also find a stable number of clusters. The learned data are used to classify a driving view into one illumination type for guiding the road perception modules in autonomous driving. We further explore the sparse coding of vehicle views under various weather and illuminations.",

    "abstract": "High-precision self-localization is one of the basic functions of intelligent vehicles. Moreover, location information is necessary prior information for tasks such as behavioural decision-making and path planning. Recently, the technology of map-based localization has been widely concerned due to its accuracy. A prior map for localization stores one or more environmental features extracted by on-board sensors. These features represent fundamental information about the ground environment such as curbs and lane markings, or the vertical environment such as building outlines. In order to enhance the robustness and positioning accuracy, this paper uses two layers of features to express the environment: one is a bottom layer composed of ground and curb features, and the other is an upper layer composed of a 2D point cloud with vertical features. Firstly, a novel collision-based detection method is proposed to extract the curb features, and a vertical-projection-based detection algorithm is used to detect vertical feature points from multilayer LIDAR. Then, the fusion of a multi-frame feature point cloud is used to represent the rich and complete information on the environment of the intelligent vehicle. Finally, the Monte Carlo localization algorithm is used to obtain an optimal estimate of the vehicle position. The experimental results indicate that the proposed localization algorithm can realize localization accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The nonlinear vehicle dynamics and the non-convexity of collision avoidance constraints pose major challenges for optimization-based trajectory planning of automated vehicles. Current solutions are either tailored to specific traffic scenarios, simplify the vehicle dynamics, are computationally demanding, or may get stuck in local minima. This work presents a novel approach to address the aforementioned shortcomings by identifying collision-free driving corridors that represent spatio-temporal constraints for motion planning using set-based reachability analysis. We derive a suitable formulation of collision avoidance constraints from driving corridors that can be integrated into arbitrary nonlinear programs as well as (successive) convexification procedures. When combining our approach with existing motion planning methods based on continuous optimization, trajectories can be planned in arbitrary traffic situations in a computationally efficient way. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using scenarios from the CommonRoad benchmark suite.",

    "publication_date": "June 2018",
    "abstract": "The intelligent vehicle community has devoted considerable efforts to model driver behavior, and in particular, to detect and overcome driver distraction in an effort to reduce accidents caused by driver negligence. However, as the domain increasingly shifts toward autonomous and semiautonomous solutions, the driver is no longer integral to the decision-making process, indicating a need to refocus efforts elsewhere. To this end, we propose to study pedestrian distraction instead. In particular, we focus on detecting pedestrians who are engaged in secondary activities involving their cellphones and similar hand-held multimedia devices from a purely vision-based standpoint. To achieve this objective, we propose a pipeline incorporating articulated human pose estimation, followed by a soft object label transfer from an ensemble of exemplar support vector machines trained on the nearest neighbors in pose feature space. We additionally incorporate head gaze features and prior pose information to carry out cellphone related pedestrian activity recognition. Finally, we offer a method to reliably track the articulated pose of a pedestrian through a sequence of images using a particle filter with a Gaussian process dynamical model, which can then be used to estimate sequentially varying activity scores at a very low computational cost. The entire framework is fast (especially for sequential data) and accurate, and easily extensible to include other secondary activities and sources of distraction.",

Our method builds on collision-free two-dimensional (2D) path-planning techniques from our previous work, and extends these techniques to 2.5D by mapping a 2D path in the parameter space onto a terrain graph surface, as a curve on the surface in the object space. Based on this path on the terrain surface, we propose a novel method of designing cross slopes in high curvature regions of the path, such that vehicles need not slow down in these regions. Furthermore, we apply time-optimal control techniques developed in robotics to compute the minimal-time speed control along the specified path.

    "abstract": "In the development of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), guaranteeing vehicle driving safety is a major concern. Among various aspects that need to be thoughtfully considered for driving safety, vehicle stability is one of the most fundamental and important factors. In this paper, to describe a guaranteed vehicle stability control problem, a new time-varying control-dependent invariant set is introduced. Correspondingly, the concept of a time-varying control-dependent barrier function (CDBF) is proposed. The proposed time-varying CDBF is more general than conventional control barrier functions (CBF), since we additionally consider invariant sets that can be time-varying and control-dependent, which will have broader applications. Then, using the proposed framework, we design a vehicle stability control algorithm, which guarantees that the vehicle states are always kept in the time-varying and control-dependent lateral stability regions. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed theory and control method are verified and discussed through illustrative simulation results of high-speed J-turn and double lane change maneuvers for an AGV.",

    "article_title": "Online Trajectory Replanning for Sudden Environmental Changes During Automated Parking: A Parallel Stitching Method",
    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2022.3156429",
    "publication_date": "Sept. 2022",
    "abstract": "Trajectory planning for automated parking has been widely known as more challenging than that for on-road driving due to the nonconvex kinematics, high-dimensional collision-avoidance constraints, and difficulty to determine the global optimum among many local optima. Changes in a dynamic environment easily make a previously planned parking trajectory invalid. Compared with the on-road planners which evade newly emerged obstacles via a nudge or side pass, a parking planner has to replan a completely different trajectory for evasion. A qualified online trajectory replanner should run fast, ensure trajectory continuity, and avoid extra halfway stops. This paper proposes a parallel stitching strategy to fulfill these demands. When the ego vehicle tracks an originally planned parking trajectory online, an evasive trajectory begins to be replanned once a new obstacle is found to block the way. Thereafter, a connective trajectory is planned, the two ends of which are future poses along the original trajectory and the evasive trajectory, respectively. The two ends of the connective trajectory are chosen by greedily evaluating various candidates via parallel computation, which ensures that our replanner runs fast with high solution quality. According to our real-world experiments and simulations, the proposed replanner outperforms the existing ones w.r.t. solution speed and quality. As an interesting feature, our proposed replanner also supports switching to a better homotopy class online.",

    "publication_date": "June 2019",
    "abstract": "Merging in congested freeway traffic is a significant challenge toward realizing fully automated (level 4) driving. Merging vehicles need to decide not only how to merge safely into a spot, but also where to merge. We present a method for freeway merge based on multipolicy decision making coupled with a reinforcement learning technique called passive actor-critic (pAC), which learns with less knowledge of the system and without active exploration. The multipolicy decision making selects a candidate spot for merging by using the state value learned by pAC. Together, these techniques yield a method that first decides where to merge and then realizes safe merging. We evaluate our method using real traffic data. Our experiments show that pAC achieves an overall success rate of 92% for merging into a predetermined spot on a freeway, which is comparable to human decision making.",

In this paper, we present a cooperative approach for starting movement detection of cyclists using a boosted stacking ensemble approach realizing feature- and decision-level cooperation. We introduce a novel method based on a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect starting motions on image sequences by learning spatio-temporal features. The CNN is complemented by a smart device based starting movement detection originating from smart devices carried by the cyclist. Both model outputs are combined in a stacking ensemble approach using an extreme gradient boosting classifier resulting in a fast and yet robust cooperative starting movement detector. We evaluate our cooperative approach on real-world data originating from experiments with 49 test subjects consisting of 84 starting motions.",

    "abstract": "Traffic accidents by elderly drivers are increasing each year in countries like Japan. Ultra-compact vehicles have attracted attention as one solution to this problem, and are looked to as a more compact, environmentally friendly, and convenient transportation means than conventional automobiles. However, their small size makes the use of conventional safety technologies difficult, and there has been little detailed research considering related safety issues. Because elderly persons are the primary target users of ultra-compact vehicles, there is a pressing need for applicable safety technologies. This research investigates miniaturized hardware for driving support that reduces the shock to passengers during sudden stopping due to the sudden appearance of obstacles. In this method, an optimal automatic stop is realized based on the distance to a detected obstacle, the speed of the vehicle, and the coefficient of friction with the road surface. We close with a description of experiments using simulations and actual machines which confirm the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The computational effort of trajectory planning for automated vehicles often increases with the complexity of the traffic situation. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical situations, in which the vehicle must react in a timely manner. We present a novel motion planning approach for automated vehicles, which combines set-based reachability analysis with convex optimization to address this issue. This combination makes it possible to find driving maneuvers even in small and convoluted solution spaces. In contrast to existing work, the computation time of our approach typically decreases, the more complex situations become. We demonstrate the benefits of our motion planner in scenarios from the CommonRoad benchmark suite and validate the approach on a real test vehicle.",

    "abstract": "The path tracking is a basic function of the autonomous vehicle. Generally, it is difficult to realize the path tracking with high accuracy at high speeds. To solve this problem, an adaptivity-enhanced path tracking system (AEPTS) is investigated in this paper. The adaptive performance of this AEPTS is realized via three aspects. The first is to achieve preview distance adaptivity by a dynamic multi-point preview model (DMPPM), which provides the desired course deviation according to the vehicle speed and the reference path. The second is to improve the adaptivity of an adaptive fuzzy steering controller (AFSC) with an adaptive steering gain model which is built via the path curvature and vehicle speed. The third is that an optimal parameter surface is devised to enhance the adaptivity of the AEPTS at high speeds. Such a surface can provide the optimal coefficients for the AEPTS, and it is implemented using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a curve fitting method. At last, simulation experiments are given to verify the adaptivity of the proposed method.",

This article introduces a general framework for tactical decision making, which combines the concepts of planning and learning, in the form of Monte Carlo tree search and deep reinforcement learning. The method is based on the AlphaGo Zero algorithm, which is extended to a domain with a continuous state space where self-play cannot be used. The framework is applied to two different highway driving cases in a simulated environment and it is shown to perform better than a commonly used baseline method. The strength of combining planning and learning is also illustrated by a comparison to using the Monte Carlo tree search or the neural network policy separately.",

    "abstract": "Lane change (LC) is one of the safety-critical manoeuvres in highway driving according to various road accident records. Thus, reliably predicting such manoeuvre in advance is critical for the safe and comfortable operation of automated driving systems. The majority of previous studies rely on detecting a manoeuvre that has been already started, rather than predicting the manoeuvre in advance. Furthermore, most of the previous works do not estimate the key timings of the manoeuvre (e.g., crossing time), which can actually yield more useful information for the decision making in the ego vehicle. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel multi-task model to simultaneously estimate the likelihood of LC manoeuvres and the time-to-lane-change (TTLC). In both tasks, an attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as a shared feature extractor from a bird’s eye view representation of the driving environment. The spatial attention used in the CNN model improves the feature extraction process by focusing on the most relevant areas of the surrounding environment. In addition, two novel curriculum learning schemes are employed to train the proposed approach. The extensive evaluation and comparative analysis of the proposed method in existing benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art LC prediction models, particularly considering long-term prediction performance.",

    "publication_date": "June 2019",
    "abstract": "The motion cueing algorithm is the procedure used to regenerate vehicle motion cues by transforming translational and rotational motions of a simulated vehicle into the simulator motion such that high fidelity motions can be generated through a washout filter. Classical washout filters are widely being used in different motion simulators because of their low computational load, simplicity, and functionality. However, they have a number of disadvantages that make them unreliable in some cases. One of the main disadvantages is its parameter selecting procedure, which is based on trial-and-error and the worst case driving scenario. In addition, the washout filter parameters are kept constant during different driving scenarios, causing inflexibility of the filter design. This causes conservative platform workspace usage and as a result false motion cues. Furthermore, the mathematical model of human motion sensation plays no role in designing of the classical washout filter. Ignorance of the online information about physical limitations of the platform and the simulator driver motion sensation factors are other main drawbacks of classical washout filters. The aim of this research is to provide a fuzzy logic-based washout filter that considers the motion sensation error between the real vehicle and simulator drivers as well as the distance of the simulator platform from its physical boundaries to correct false motion cues and decrease human sensation errors. The proposed fuzzy-based washout filter also seeks to increase motion fidelity and enable the simulator to use the platform workspace more efficiently. The simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed fuzzy-based washout filter in reducing the human sensation error and enhancing efficiency of the simulator platform workspace usage.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2021.3060626",
    "publication_date": "Dec. 2021",
    "abstract": "The design of cooperative adaptive cruise control is critical in mixed traffic flow, where connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist. Compared with pure CAVs, the major challenge is how to handle the prediction uncertainty of HDVs, which can cause significant state deviation of CAVs from planned trajectories. In most existing studies, model predictive control (MPC) is utilized to replan CAVs’ trajectories to mitigate the deviation at each time step. However, as the replanning process is usually conducted by solving an optimization problem with information through inter-vehicular communication, MPC methods suffer from heavy computational and communicational burdens. To address this limitation, a robust platoon control framework is proposed based on tube MPC in this paper. The prediction uncertainty is dynamically mitigated by the feedback control and restricted inside a set with a high probability. When the uncertainty exceeds the set or additional external disturbance emerges, the feedforward control is triggered to plan a “tube” (a sequence of sets), which can bound CAVs’ actual trajectories. As the replanning process is usually not required, the proposed method is much more efficient regarding computation and communication, compared with the MPC method. Comprehensive simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Challenges related to automated driving are no longer focused on just the construction of such automated vehicles (AVs) but also on assuring the safety of operation. Recent advances in Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving have motivated more extensive study in safety guarantees of complicated AV maneuvers, which aligns with the goal of ISO 21448 (Safety of the Intended Functions or SOTIF), i.e., minimizing unsafe scenarios both known and unknown, as well as Vision Zero – eliminating highway fatalities by 2050. A majority of approaches used in providing safety guarantees for AV motion control originate from formal methods, especially reachability analysis (RA), which relies on mathematical models for the dynamic evolution of the system to provide guarantees. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been no review papers dedicated to describing and interpreting state-of-the-art of formal methods in the context of AVs. In this work, we provide both an overview of the safety verification, validation, and certification process, as well as a review of formal safety techniques that are best suited to AV applications. We also propose a unified scenario coverage framework that can provide either a formal or sample-based estimate of safety verification for full AVs. Finally, challenges and future opportunities beyond the scope of current published research for assured AV safety are presented.",

In order to consider the differences in vehicle dynamics between the real vehicle and this constant nominal model, a tube-based robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is introduced. The proposed control algorithm is designed in order to guarantee proper path tracking, not only considering lateral error, but also orientation error to the target trajectory.

This is a major challenge in autonomous driving, since the future behavior of other traffic participants is not known and since traffic participants are often hidden due to occlusions. In this work, we propose a formal set-based prediction that contains all acceptable future behaviors of both detected and potentially hidden traffic participants. Based on formalized traffic rules and nondeterministic motion models, we perform reachability analysis to predict the set of possible occupancies and velocities of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. Real-world experiments with a test vehicle in various traffic situations demonstrate the applicability and real-time capability of our over-approximative prediction for both online verification and fail-safe trajectory planning. Even in congested, complex traffic scenarios, our forecasting approach enables self-driving vehicles to never cause accidents.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a problem on infrared maritime target detection robustly in various situations. Its main contribution is to improve the infrared maritime target detection accuracy in different backgrounds, for various targets, using multiple infrared wave bands. The accuracy and the computational time of traditional infrared maritime searching systems are improved by our proposed Local Peak Singularity Measurement (LPSM)-Based Image Enhancement and Grayscale Distribution Curve Shift Binarization (GDCSB)-Based Target Segmentation. The first part uses LPSM to quantize the local singularity of each peak. Additionally, an enhancement map (EM) is generated based on the quantitative local singularity. After multiplying the original image by the EM, targets can be enhanced and the background will be suppressed. The second part of GDCSB-Based Target Segmentation calculates the desired threshold by cyclic shift of the grayscale distribution curve (GDC) of the enhanced image. After binarizing the enhanced image, real targets can be segmented from the image background. To verify the proposed algorithm, experiments based on 13,625 infrared maritime images and five comparison algorithms were conducted. Results show that the proposed algorithm has solid performance in strong and weak background clutters, different wave bands, different maritime targets, etc.",

    "abstract": "Global localization on LiDAR point cloud maps is a challenging task because of the sparse nature of point clouds and the large size difference between LiDAR scans and the maps. In this paper, we solve the LiDAR-based global localization problem based upon the plane-motion assumption. We first project the clouds into Bird’s-eye View (BV) images and transform the problem into a BV image matching problem. We then introduce a novel local descriptor, \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>\n, Histogram of Orientations of Principal Normals (HOPN), to perform matching. The HOPN descriptor encodes the point normals of the clouds, and is more effective in matching BV images than the common image descriptors. In addition, we present the consensus set maximization algorithm to robustly estimate a rigid pose from the HOPN matches in the case of the low inlier ratio. The experimental results on three large-scale datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art global localization performance when using either single LiDAR scans or local maps.",

    "abstract": "Highly-automated driving requires drivers to take over the control of their vehicle in any situation. In takeover situations with small time headways, a fast takeover is crucial. Here, drivers could be supported by an appropriate takeover request. This article presents a driving simulator study investigating whether less critical takeover situations and a match between the urgency of a takeover request and the criticality of the takeover situation benefits drivers regarding their takeover performance and subjective experience. Fifty-two participants experienced two takeover situations with varying time headways (small and large). A low urgent, visual-tactile takeover-request was presented to half of the participants. The other half experienced a highly urgent, visual-tactile takeover request, resulting in two conditions, in which the takeover requests matched the criticality of the takeover situation, and in two conditions, in which the takeover requests did not match. The results showed that participants generally performed better in low critical takeover situations, but they took over quicker in highly critical situations. However, a match neither shortens takeover time nor enhances subjective experience.",

    "publication_date": "June 2019",
    "abstract": "In emergency situations, autonomous vehicles will be forced to operate at their friction limits in order to avoid collisions. In these scenarios, coordinating the planning of the vehicle's path and speed gives the vehicle the best chance of avoiding an obstacle. Fast reaction time is also important in an emergency, but approaches to the trajectory planning problem based on nonlinear optimization are computationally expensive. This paper presents a new scheme that simultaneously modifies the desired path and speed profile for a vehicle in response to the appearance of an obstacle, significant tracking error, or other environmental change. By formulating the trajectory optimization problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program, solution times of less than 20 ms are possible even with a 10-s planning horizon. A simplified point mass model is used to describe the vehicle's motion, but the incorporation of longitudinal weight transfer and road topography means that the vehicle's acceleration limits are modeled more accurately than in comparable approaches. Experimental data from an autonomous vehicle in two scenarios demonstrate how the trajectory planner enables the vehicle to avoid an obstacle even when the obstacle appears suddenly and the vehicle is already operating near the friction limits.",

    "publication_date": "Dec. 2018",
    "abstract": "Steering control for path tracking in autonomous vehicles is well documented in the literature. Also, continuous direct yaw moment control, i.e., torque-vectoring, applied to human-driven electric vehicles with multiple motors is extensively researched. However, the combination of both controllers is not yet well understood. This paper analyzes the benefits of torque-vectoring in an autonomous electric vehicle, either by integrating the torque-vectoring system into the path tracking controller, or through its separate implementation alongside the steering controller for path tracking. A selection of path tracking controllers is compared in obstacle avoidance tests simulated with an experimentally validated vehicle dynamics model. A genetic optimization is used to select the controller parameters. Simulation results confirm that torque-vectoring is beneficial to autonomous vehicle response. The integrated controllers achieve the best performance if they are tuned for the specific tire-road friction condition. However, they can also cause unstable behavior when they operate under lower friction conditions without any re-tuning. On the other hand, separate torque-vectoring implementations provide a consistently stable cornering response for a wide range of friction conditions. Controllers with preview formulations, or based on appropriate reference paths with respect to the middle line of the available lane, are beneficial to the path tracking performance.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads calls for the development of methods that are reliably able to mitigate injury severity in case of unavoidable collisions. This study proposes a data-driven motion planning method capable of minimizing injury severity for vehicle occupants in unavoidable collisions. The method is based on establishing a metric that models the relationship between impact location and injury severity using real accident data, and subsequently including it in the cost function of a motion planning framework. The vehicle dynamics and associated constraints are considered through a precomputed trajectory library, which is generated by solving an optimal control problem. This allows for efficient computation as well as an accurate representation of the vehicle. The proposed motion planning approach is evaluated by simulation, and it is shown that the trajectory associated with the minimum cost mitigates the collision severity for occupants of passenger vehicles involved in the collision.",

    "abstract": "To bridge the gap between autonomous and normal steering during low lateral acceleration maneuvers, a steering-wheel torque controller is developed. It consists of three controllers in series, a high-gain feedback steering-wheel torque controller, a nonlinear steering-angle controller, and a linear yaw-rate controller. A validated two degrees of freedom steering-system model, in combination with a single-track vehicle model, is used to determine the controller parameters. Driving tests with different drivers have been executed to find a comfortable steering-wheel torque/angle relation. This relation is maintained throughout the lane change by specifying the steering-wheel torque as a function of the steering-wheel angle tracking error. Experiments show promising results regarding the driver/vehicle interaction, but also show that a system to detect the lanes and the vehicle position on the road is required for further improvement.",

    "abstract": "Under certain scenarios, an automated driving system (ADS) might need to transfer steering control to the human driver. Even if the driver is ready to take over, an abrupt control transition when traversing a curve can lead to unstable steering. This is because the steering wheel is balanced by both the self-aligning torque and ADS torque; if the latter suddenly disappears, the balance is lost. In this study, we developed a method for transferring control when traversing a curve via haptic shared control. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrated that the proposed method exhibits better steering and vehicle motion stability than a non-shared control method.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2022.3162845",
    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "High-precision localization is an important task for intelligent vehicles. Previous studies have used the raw point cloud for mapping and localization. The problems with this method are the large storage requirement of the map for localization in large-scale areas, and the many meaningless points that do not contribute to localization, and may even degenerate localization results, and result in drift and failure in the map matching process. This paper presents a robust localization method for intelligent vehicles based on the proposed compressed road scene map to solve these problems. This work consists of three parts: mapping, map matching, and sensor fusion. For mapping, the point cloud is first converted to 3D occupancy grids, and the grids are projected on a plane perpendicular to the ground and parallel to the longitudinal direction. This will produce a 2D grid map, which we name a compressed road scene map because it can reflect the depth of the road scene. For map matching, a Monte Carlo framework is used to sample several hypothetical real-time compressed road scenes, and the normalized information distance is used to measure the similarity between the hypothetical real-time compressed road scenes and the compressed road scene map. For sensor fusion, vehicle motion data provided by the IMU and wheel encoders are fused with the map matching result. The experimental results show that the storage of the compressed road scene map decreases substantially compared with the raw point cloud. The robustness and precision of the proposed localization method is also demonstrated via real-vehicle experiments in large-scale areas.",

    "abstract": "Many passenger vehicles are equipped with automatic safety features. One system, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), saved 7,024 lives from 2011 to 2015. While effective, ESC and other similar control systems are reactionary in nature and require knowledge of a vehicle's current state to determine the response at the next state. Also, many control systems do not take the road characteristics into account, despite being an important contributor to a vehicle's dynamics. This work presents a predictive vehicle controller to help prevent roadside departures during cornering that incorporates the road's geometry and roughness to estimate the vehicle's safe operating speed. An Optimized Speed Profile generates a speed trajectory to allow the vehicle to successfully navigate the corner while preserving ride quality. Simulation results demonstrate cases in which vehicles equipped with ESC would depart from the road while the proposed system does not. Simulations demonstrate that road roughness effects account for up to 10% of the velocity changes in the maximum allowable cornering speed; simulations based on a real-world highway off-ramp measurement demonstrate that the proposed control system is capable of lane-keeping while maintaining stability.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles are gaining increased attention but surveys have shown that a large percentage of people are wary of adopting the new technology. One possible explanation for the hesitancy is that the occupant would not be comfortable with the driving style as a result of the control models and their parameters as set by the manufacture. Comfort level is subjective in nature and therefore varies between individuals. To combat this issue, autonomous vehicles must be able to adapt to the driving style preference of the user. If we assume drivers are more comfortable with their own driving style, we can choose to have the vehicle learn and incorporate the driver's style into the control models. However, there is still no widely accepted “best” model. One model may prove to better represent a particular driver than other models though a driver may choose unsafe driving conditions, the replication of which should not take precedence over the safety of the occupant. In this paper, we propose a multimodel approach to find the best driver model for describing an individual's longitudinal driving style on highway. A method for extracting the indicators of an individual's driving style is proposed first. Then, a multimodel-based evaluation method is described in detail. Chandler, Herman, & Montroll, General Motors Nonlinear, Tampère, Addison & Low, Optimal Velocity Model, and Neural Network models are trained and compared in this paper. The model with the best performance in replicating driving style is further coupled with a model predictive controller to include safety constraints for safer driving. Finally, the proposed multimodel approach is tested with driving data collected from five different drivers. The test results show that our multimodel-based approach is showing advantage over a single model approach in imitating an individual's longitudinal driving style.",

    "abstract": "With the help of a multiview system, an unmanned vehicle system can better understand the surrounding environment and choose a more accurate and safer path to avoid obstacles. However, due to the interference of the signal or the loss of part of the signal during the acquisition, processing, compression, transmission and decompression of the video image signal, the local area of the image is abnormal, which affects the perception and decision of the system. This article addresses the problems of inaccurate restored images and noise in the restored images by proposing an image restoration method that is applied to a multicamera system. We utilize different perspective images captured by different cameras to assist and constrain the restoration of the damaged image. This method restores the image by combining sample representations and sample distribution models which respectively based on self-encoder reconstruction loss learning and generative adversarial networks. In this method, the infrastructure is a conditional generative adversarial network, the condition is the images that are from the other perspectives, and the generator is a self-encoder structure with cross-layer connection, group convolution and feature map channel exchanged. This method was carried out on a dataset recorded in Zurich using a pair of cameras mounted on a mobile platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods in terms of mean L1 Loss, mean L2 Loss and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).",

    "abstract": "As a novel computing paradigm, multiaccess edge computing (MEC) migrates computing and storage capabilities to edge nodes of the network to meet the requirements of executing computationally intensive or delay-sensitive tasks on intelligent vehicles. In addition, MEC fills the gap between cloud computing and terminals in vehicular networks. In the MEC system, to reduce the load on MEC servers with large-scale vehicle deployment and promote the efficient use of network resources, vehicles can also transfer tasks to neighboring resource-rich vehicles using cooperative computation offloading. However, cooperative computation offloading between vehicles faces the challenges of security and insufficient information about the server vehicle. Therefore, this paper proposes using blockchain technology to achieve efficient data sharing between vehicles and service providers (i.e., server vehicles) and ensure the security of computation offloading between vehicles. First, we design a secure data sharing architecture in blockchain-based vehicular edge computing networks. Then, a new consensus mechanism in this architecture is proposed to improve the efficiency of data sharing and prevent malicious attacks. Furthermore, we present a cooperative offloading decision-making method using an offloading game, and the Nash equilibrium of the offloading strategy is achieved using this method. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a monocular camera-based method is proposed to estimate the steering angle in autonomous driving. A second-order particle filtering algorithm is used to estimate the steering angles. The filtering algorithm is modeled at the scene-level for varying driving patterns. For a given road scene, individual proposal and likelihood distributions are modeled with deep learning-based regression frameworks for normal driving and obstacle avoidance driving patterns, respectively, the proposal distribution is modeled using a novel long short-term memory-based mixture-of-expert; and the likelihood is modeled using a convolutional neural network. To estimate the driving pattern captured from the monocular camera, a long recurrent convolutional network is adopted and trained. By modeling the distribution at the scene-level for different driving patterns, we accurately model the particle filter distributions. Consequently, for autonomous driving, the steering angle is robustly estimated with few particles. The proposed framework is validated on multiple acquired sequences. A detailed comparative and parametric analysis of the algorithm is performed. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our filtering algorithm for varying road scenes and driving behaviors.",

    "publication_date": "Dec. 2019",
    "abstract": "Online multi-object tracking (MOT) is extremely important for high-level spatial reasoning and path planning for autonomous and highly-automated vehicles. In this paper, we present a modular framework for tracking multiple objects (vehicles), capable of accepting object proposals from different sensor modalities (vision and range) and a variable number of sensors, to produce continuous object tracks. This work is a generalization of the MDP framework for MOT proposed by Xiang et al., with some key extensions - First, we track objects across multiple cameras and across different sensor modalities. This is done by fusing object proposals across sensors accurately and efficiently. Second, the objects of interest (targets) are tracked directly in the real world. This is a departure from traditional techniques where objects are simply tracked in the image plane. Doing so allows the tracks to be readily used by an autonomous agent for navigation and related tasks. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we test it on real world highway data collected from a heavily sensorized testbed capable of capturing full-surround information. We demonstrate that our framework is well-suited to track objects through entire maneuvers around the ego-vehicle, some of which take more than a few minutes to complete. We also leverage the modularity of our approach by comparing the effects of including/excluding different sensors, changing the total number of sensors, and the quality of object proposals on the final tracking result.",

    "abstract": "An adequate charging infrastructure advocates to ameliorate the range anxiety to propel the disparaged electric vehicle (EV) market. But, the high initial installation cost, requirement of suitable places and the anticipated immense load on the grid during peak times hinder to elongate the charging station network, especially in urban areas. Fortunately, the bidirectional energy transferring capability between vehicles (i.e., V2V) may act as an auxiliary solution to charge an EV at any place and at any time without leaning on a stationary charging infrastructure. In this work, we assume a market where charging providers each has a number of charging trucks equipped with a larger battery and a fast charger to charge a number of EVs at some particular parking lots. A provider intends to maximize the served number of EVs using its limited number of charging trucks, when an EV should be considered as served only if it would be fully charged during its declared charging window. All charging requests are assumed to be received by an agent which provisions a route and schedule for each charging truck and all trucks should return to the depot after serving EVs. We formulate this combinatorially hard problem as an integer linear program (ILP) to maximize the number of served EVs by determining the optimal trajectory of each truck. Owing to its complexity, we present a solution methodology by decomposing the problem using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition approach; we divide the problem into one master problem and a set of pricing problems (one for each EV) and achieve the solution iteratively. Though the solution achieved from the decomposition might not be optimal, it is faster to be applicable in practice. We also compare the performance with two heuristic algorithms and report on the collected results.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a motion planning framework for automated vehicles to drive safely through intersections despite occlusions and the uncertain behavior of the surrounding vehicles. A context representation based on probably-free gaps is proposed as a means to provide, in occluded scenes, richer information to the motion planner compared to representations only based on observed objects. Our solution builds upon the path-velocity decomposition approach. Path planning is performed with state-of-the-art techniques, while a novel trajectory abstraction is used to reason about speed profiles without explicitly generating sequences of accelerations. To efficiently identify the best safe speed profile for every path candidate, a reachability-based analysis is also formulated. The proposed planning workflow is evaluated in roundabout scenarios. Our simulation study shows that the proposed context representation facilitates the decision-making in occluded scenes and that the reachability-based planning strategy is robust, computationally efficient, and outperforms a simpler reactive strategy.",

    "abstract": "Various learning-based approaches have been proposed recently for robot control in complex unknown environments. However, ensuring safety in these systems is essential. Learning-based approaches are usually black-box systems which are difficult to interpret/verify. We propose a real-time continuous safety checking system which monitors the validity of the mapping from the sensor input to the actuator command (i.e., controller-focused anomaly detection) and from the actuator command to the sensor input (i.e., system-focused anomaly detection). Our controller-focused anomaly monitor is an image conditioned energy based generative adversarial network in which the discriminator acts as an energy function attributing low energies to proper actuator commands and high energy to anomalous actuator commands. Our system-focused anomaly monitor is based on an action condition video prediction framework, which finds the action conditioned future frame most similar to the actual future frame and compares it with the true action to detect anomaly. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for an autonomous navigation system in indoor (on datasets from our ground vehicle) and outdoor environments (on Udacity dataset). Furthermore, we show through experimental evaluations that our proposed framework is resilient to various data corruptions common in a vision based system.",

    "abstract": "Car-following is an important driving behaviour for intelligent vehicles and has a significant impact on traffic efficiency and traffic safety. Car-following models are widely developed to characterize the human-drivers’ car-following manoeuvre actions and adopted in traffic simulation and automated vehicle control system development. Car-following models need to be able to represent the drivers’ behaviour while following preceding vehicles. On the other hand, car-following controllers are an important component of intelligent vehicle systems, both for autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles. However, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) as well as Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) do not include human behaviour, which makes their car-following behaviour not human-like or natural for the on-board driver or passenger. To address this problem, in this study, the human-like Wiedemann car-following model is calibrated and verified with our driving simulator data. A human-like car-following nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) controller is developed based on the calibrated car-following model. Three different scenarios are tested to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller, with which the autonomous vehicle is able to have human-like and smooth trajectories at different phases and within different transition zones.",

    "abstract": "Usage-based-insurance is an emerging automobile insurance service in which the driver premium is set individually for each policyholder. A personalized automobile insurance mechanism presents challenges that differ from those presented by the general driver assistance applications that analyze driver behaviors. In this paper, a novel framework based on boosted multiple-kernel learning is proposed to reflect the driving risk level of each driver for automobile usage-based-insurance. In the proposed framework, a set of kernels is specified to represent the inherent characteristics of vehicle-oriented, driver-oriented, and lane-oriented attributes. These multiple kernels are carefully integrated using the AdaBoost technique to realize particular collaborative features for driving risk assessment. Experimental results obtained using a lab-recorded driving data set under real-world conditions reveal that the proposed framework exhibits impressive accuracy and robustness in terms of different driving-risk levels.",

    "publication_date": "June 2020",
    "abstract": "To accelerate self-driving technology developments, testing platforms modified from production passenger cars are widely used nowadays, but the powertrain models and control access to engine/motor are often not available, e.g., the popular hybrid Lincoln MKZ platform only opens brake/throttle pedal control protocol for longitudinal motion. These limitations motivate us to model the powertrain dynamics by experiments and to design new speed controls, differing from the conventional cruise control that manipulates engine/brake torque directly with accurate models. This article explores the powertrain modeling and speed control algorithm design of these testing platforms, by taking the MKZ as an example. Two computationally-efficient algorithms are designed, i.e., a PID\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\nC control when future information (i.e., reference speed and road slope profiles) is unavailable, and a preview control if the information is provided a priori. To guarantee speed tracking errors within a given safe range, a barrier control is also designed to supervise the two controllers, which adds additional brake/throttle actions when the error is approaching the boundary. The algorithms are implemented and tested on the Mcity MKZ platform, experimental results show the speed-tracking performance and the bounded errors achieved by the barrier function.",

    "abstract": "Todays, Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions, densely populated urban areas air quality problems, and depleting fossil fuel concerns motivated motorcycle producers in crowded countries to explore electric propulsion systems. Due to energy storage system constraints, Pure Electric Motorcycles (PEM) range is restricted, so an effective Energy Management System is required to optimize PEM consumed energy. As road curvature is an inevitable part of real roads, this article, proposes a novel Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) based on road geometry which first analyses road data to identify curvature and straight parts. Then, SEMS solves optimization problems separately and optimal speed is calculated in direct and curvature parts independently. The proposed SEMS can communicate to the driver as an eco-driving system by receiving trip time importance and presenting each road point optimal speed. Because of fast response necessity, Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA) is used in this article to solve SEMS optimization problem. For evaluation purposes, three scenarios are defined: The test road is travelled at motorcycle maximum allowable speed in the first scenario. In the 2nd one, PEM speed is also constant but it equals to direct road optimal speed instead of max. speed. Independent optimal speed in direct and curvature parts is considered in 3rd scenario. Simulation results show the significant effect of road curves on consumed energy and SEMS good performance in optimization of PEM consumed energy.",

    "abstract": "Modeling Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) vehicles enables the understanding of the impact of these vehicles on traffic flow. In this work, two online methods are used to provide real time system identification of ACC enabled vehicles. The first technique is a recursive least squares (RLS) approach, while the second method solves a nonlinear joint state and parameter estimation problem via particle filtering (PF). We provide a parameter identifiability analysis for both methods to analytically show that the model parameters are not identifiable using equilibrium driving. The accuracy and computational runtime of the online methods are compared to a commonly used offline simulation-based optimization (i.e., batch optimization) approach. The methods are tested on synthetic data as well as on empirical data collected directly from a 2019 model year ACC vehicle using data from sensors that are part of the stock ACC system. The online methods are scalable and provide comparable accuracy to the batch method. RLS runs in real time and is two orders of magnitude faster than the batch method for modest sized (e.g., 15 min) datasets. The particle filter also runs in real-time, and is also suitable in streaming applications in which the datasets can grow arbitrarily large.",

    "abstract": "This paper compares two models for context-based path prediction of objects with switching dynamics: a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). These models are instances of two larger model categories, distinguished by whether expert knowledge is explicitly crafted into the state representation (and thus is interpretable) or whether the representation is learned from data, respectively. Both have shown state-of-the-art performance in previous work. In order to provide a fair comparison, we ensure that both models are treated similarly with respect to the use of context cues and parameter estimation. Specifically, we describe (1) how to integrate the context cues (used previously by the DBN) into the RNN, and (2) how to optimize the DBN with back-propagation similar to the RNN, while keeping an interpretable state representation. Experiments are performed on a scenario where a cyclist might turn left at an intersection in front of the ego-vehicle. Results show that the RNN successfully leverages the context cues, and that optimizing the DBN improves its performance with respect to existing work. While the RNN outperforms the optimized DBN in predictive log-likelihood by a significant margin, both models attain similar average Euclidean distance errors (23–39 cm for DBN and 31–34 cm for RNN, predicting 1 s ahead).",

Longitudinal and lateral controllers are designed to enable a connected automated vehicle (CAV) to utilize V2X information from nearby connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs). The linear stability of the controllers are investigated theoretically while taking into account the time delays in the feedback loops. Novel performance measures are introduced to quantify the plant and string stability properties of the longitudinal controller from experimental data. The stability of the lateral controller is also evaluated in lane-keeping experiments.

    "abstract": "An autonomous measurement outlier detection and exclusion framework for ground vehicle navigation using cellular signals is developed. The ground vehicle aids its onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) with cellular signals in a tightly-coupled fashion in the absence of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. First, cellular pseudoranges are characterized from an extensive wardriving campaign collected with a ground vehicle in different environments: open sky, urban, and deep urban. Then, a framework is developed, which accounts for outliers due to line-of-sight blockage and short multipath delays. These outliers induce biases in cellular pseudoranges and compromise the integrity of the navigation solution. Experimental results are presented evaluating the efficacy of the proposed framework on a ground vehicle navigating in the absence of GNSS signals. The results demonstrate the proposed framework detecting and excluding outliers, reducing the position root mean squared error (RMSE) by 41.5% and the maximum position error by 43.1%.",

    "abstract": "Electric mining haul trucks (EMHTs) used for “short distance” mining transportation undergo a high-frequency of start-ups which can be highly energy consuming. This paper proposes an energy saving control (ESC) strategy for the high-frequency start-up process of EMHTs. To design the ESC strategy, a system model is established based on the characteristics of the power transfer mechanism of the EMHT drive system. With this model, the ESC strategy is designed using optimal control theory. The Hamilton function is reconstructed and the Pontryagin minimum principle is used to formulate the ESC strategy by taking the energy consumption and the response time into account. Based on this strategy, an ESC-strategy-based control algorithm for EMHT is designed by selecting the switching time according to the system boundary condition. To verify the ESC strategy performance, the simulation model of dc drive 154t EMTH is built with MATLAB. Compared with the constant power control and the driver's manual control, the ESC strategy enjoys better dynamic performances and a lower energy consumption in the start-up process.",

To deal with such a large variety of usage conditions and patterns, personalization methods have been developed to ensure optimal user experience. In this article we review current approaches in the literature that demonstrate an adaptation to the drivers' preferences, driving styles, skills and driving patterns. We discuss the general assumptions on which personalization in the automotive context is based, the general design of personalized ADAS, the current approaches with their practical realization and point out open issues in the design and implementation of a personalized driving experience. Based on this analysis we propose a general conceptual framework to personalization in ADAS. It suggests a modular decomposition for the next generation of personalized ADAS and HMI which can be expected to continuously adapt in interaction with the driver.",

    "publication_date": "June 2021",
    "abstract": "A cooperative control approach for autonomous vehicles is developed in order to perform different complex traffic maneuvers, e.g., double lane-switching or intersection situations. The problem is formulated as a distributed optimal control problem for a system of multiple autonomous vehicles, and then solved using a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique, where the distributed approach is used to make the problem computationally feasible in real-time. To provide safety, a collision avoidance constraint is introduced, also in a distributed way. In the proposed method, each vehicle computes its own control inputs using estimated states of neighboring vehicles. In addition, a compatibility constraint is defined that takes collision avoidance into account but also ensures that each vehicle does not deviate significantly from what is expected by neighboring vehicles. The method allows us to construct a cost function for several different traffic scenarios. The asymptotic convergence of the system to the desired destination is proven, in the absence of uncertainty, and disturbances, for a sufficiently small MPC control horizon. Simulation results show that the distributed algorithm scales well with increasing number of vehicles.",

    "publication_date": "Dec. 2019",
    "abstract": "In a typical multitarget tracking (MTT) scenario, the sensor state is either assumed known, or tracking is performed in the sensor's (relative) coordinate frame. This assumption does not hold when the sensor, e.g., an automotive radar, is mounted on a vehicle, and the target state should be represented in a global (absolute) coordinate frame. Then it is important to consider the uncertain location of the vehicle on which the sensor is mounted for MTT. In this paper, we present a multisensor low complexity Poisson multi-Bernoulli MTT filter, which jointly tracks the uncertain vehicle state and target states. Measurements collected by different sensors mounted on multiple vehicles with varying location uncertainty are incorporated sequentially based on the arrival of new sensor measurements. In doing so, targets observed from a sensor mounted on a well-localized vehicle reduce the state uncertainty of other poorly localized vehicles, provided that a common non-empty subset of targets is observed. A low complexity filter is obtained by approximations of the joint sensor-target state density minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Results from synthetic as well as experimental measurement data, collected in a vehicle driving scenario, demonstrate the performance benefits of joint vehicle-target state tracking.",

    "abstract": "As the market share of electric vehicles increases, the associated charging infrastructure must be further developed to meet the growing demand for charging. While stationary plug-in methods have been the traditional approach to satisfying this demand, in-motion charging technologies have the potential to eliminate the inconvenience of long charging wait times and the high cost of large batteries. In this research, an agent-based model is developed to simulate vehicle charging demand and then validated against real traffic data. Driver behavior is estimated from travel survey data, and a method is introduced to estimate route-planning decisions in the presence of multiple charging options. The model is technology agnostic, allowing for its application to any kind of in-motion charging technology (i.e., inductive, conductive, and capacitive). A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the location of roadways with dynamic charging capabilities in the presence of the existing charging infrastructure. Both major highways and arterial roads were considered as potential candidates for dynamic charger installation. Results are presented for a case study in Salt Lake County, Utah.",

In a virtual proving ground, challenging and highly unlikely scenarios can be created and novel control algorithms can be tested with no safety concerns and relatively little cost. A critical component of any virtual proving ground is sensor simulation; i.e., the ability to produce realistic sensor information inside the simulated environment. This paper overviews several models and methods for generating, through simulation, GPS, IMU, and lidar data. While the current models can account for some sensor noise, significant work remains to be done in order to produce simulated data that is realistic and can be used to confidently test and evaluate autonomous agents in virtual proving grounds.",

    "abstract": "The security of cyber-physical systems, such as vehicle platoons, is critical to ensuring their proper operation and acceptance to society. In platooning, vehicles follow one another according to an agreed-upon control law that determines vehicle separation. We show that a vehicle within a platoon and under the control of a malicious actor could cause collisions or decrease the efficiency of surrounding vehicles. This paper focuses on detecting, identifying, and mitigating so-called destabilizing attacks that could cause vehicle collisions. Our approach is decentralized and requires only local sensor information for each vehicle to identify the vehicle responsible for the attack and then deploy an appropriate mitigating controller that prevents collisions. We use a Deep Learning approach (Convolutional Neural Network) with various data preprocessing techniques to detect and identify the malicious vehicle. Results indicate that even with decent noise levels in range and relative speed data, we achieve accuracy up to 96.3%. Also, once the adversarial vehicle is localized, we derive conditions for controller gains using the Routh Hurwitz criterion to mitigate the attack and ensure the stability of the platoon. Realistic simulator CARLA and MATLAB simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.",

    "abstract": "In cellular vehicular communications, high density and mobility of vehicles require frequent resource allocation, which can cause network congestion and large signalling and processing delay. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel semi-persistent resource allocation scheme based on a two-tier heterogeneous network architecture. The architecture includes a central macro base station (MBS) and multiple roadside units (RSU). In the proposed semi-persistent scheme, the MBS pre-allocates persistent resource to RSUs based on predicted traffic, and then allocates dynamic resource upon real-time requests from RSUs while vehicles simultaneously communicate using the pre-allocated resource. A simple Space-Time k-Nearest Neighbour (ST-kNN) method is developed for short-term traffic prediction, and a geometric water-filling algorithm is developed for minimizing the relative latency. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-persistent scheme in comparison with two benchmark schemes.",

    "abstract": "A new adaptive robust control scheme combining the disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) with fuzzy adapted S-Surface control is proposed for trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicle. The main contribution of the proposed method is that control configuration does not require the bounds of uncertainty of the vehicle to be known and disturbances effect can be estimated and rejected. The proposed control law is mainly composed of three parts: a feed forward control along with disturbance estimator, S-Surface control and single input adaptive fuzzy proportional-integral (PI) compensator. The nominal feed forward controller specifies desired closed loop dynamics with extravagance from known preferred acceleration vector. Meanwhile, the disturbance observer and adaptive fuzzy PI control term to compensate the unknown effects that are disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. An additional term as S-Surface control assures fast convergence due to a nonlinear expression in to surface and also enhance stability of the underwater vehicle in oceanic environment. Moreover, the disturbance observer enhances the robustness performance of the adaptive fuzzy system for disturbances that cannot be modeled by fuzzy logic. The stability of closed loop controlled system is proven to be guaranteed according to Lyapunov theory. Finally, numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control method.",

    "abstract": "There are many constraints to be considered to plan a safe and feasible trajectory for autonomous mining trucks due to the rough terrain in open-pit mines. It is difficult to handle these constraints uniformly within a trajectory planning framework. To overcome this limitation, a novel trajectory planning framework is proposed in this paper. Different from many existing studies which characterized the spatial positions of vehicles at the sampling time points as decision variables, we characterize the time points at the sampling spatial positions as decision variables to conveniently address the terrain constraints. Based on such a formulation, we further consider the kinematic constraints, engine power constraints and time window constraints. Various objectives (e.g., transport efficiency, fuel economy) can be considered in this trajectory planning framework, and the formulated trajectory planning problems can be efficiently solved. Finally, several case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework.",

    "abstract": "Multimodality fusion based on deep neural networks (DNN) is a significant method for intelligent vehicles. The special characteristics of DNN lead to the issue of AI safety and safety test. In this paper, we firstly propose a multimodality fusion framework called Integrated Multimodality Fusion Deep Neural Network (IMF-DNN), which can flexibly accomplish both object detection and end-to-end driving policy for prediction of steering angle and speed. Then, we propose a DNN safety test strategy, which systematically analyzes DNN's robustness and generalization ability in large amounts of diverse driving environment conditions. The test in this paper is based on our IMF-DNN model and the strategy can be widely used for other DNNs. Finally, the experiment analysis is performed on KITTI for object detection and the dateset DBNet for end-to-end tasks. The results show the superior accuracy of the proposed IMF-DNN model and the test strategy's potential ability to improve the robustness and generalization of autonomous vehicle deep learning model.

In order to estimate the pose information of moving vehicles accurately, 3D-LiDAR is widely used for accurate distance data. This paper proposed a real-time tracking algorithm based on L-Shape fitting. The algorithm detects the corners of moving vehicles and uses RANSAC to take a limited amount of noisy data. In addition, a vehicle tracking system with multi-weight Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filtering (RBPF) is built upon the orientation estimation given by L-Shape fitting. The proposed algorithm is validated on the KITTI dataset and a manually labeled dataset acquired from an autonomous vehicle at Carnegie Mellon University. Furthermore, the proposed solution is implemented in an autonomous vehicle at Tongji University. The experiments illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves real-time performance, mitigates the effect of noisy data and improves estimation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a mechanical system inspired microscopic traffic model to characterize the longitudinal interaction among a chain of vehicles. In particular, we propose a mass-spring-damper-clutch based car-following (CF) model that can naturally capture the car-following behavior of a rational driver. Specifically, the spring and damper can well characterize the driver’s tendency to maintain the same speed as the vehicle ahead while keeping a (speed-dependent) desired spacing. It is also capable of characterizing the impact of the following vehicle on the preceding vehicle, which is generally neglected in existing models. A new string stability criterion is defined for the considered multi-vehicle dynamics, and stability analysis is performed on the system parameters and time delays. An efficient online parameter identification algorithm, sequential recursive least squares with inverse QR decomposition (SRLS-IQR), is developed to estimate the driving-related model parameters. These real-time estimated parameters can be employed in advanced longitudinal control systems to enable accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories for improved safety and fuel efficiency. The proposed model and the parameter identification algorithm are validated on NGSIM, a naturalistic driving dataset, as well as our own connected vehicle driving data. Promising performance is demonstrated.",

    "publication_date": "June 2021",
    "abstract": "Various drowsiness detection systems have been developed to prevent traffic accidents. Drivers feel such systems are annoying or useless when the systems provide many false drowsiness alarms. Drowsy driving prevention systems should satisfy the following three features to be accepted by many drivers: 1) Precise drowsiness detection, 2) Drowsy driving warning whereby drivers are less annoyed by false alarms, and 3) Mechanisms that promote drivers to adopt active behavior to maintain his/her wakefulness. The present work proposes a new drowsy driving prevention system that has these features. The proposed system, referred to as a wakefulness-keeping support system (WKSS), consists of a drowsiness detection system (DDS), which corresponds to the first feature, and an active game system (AGS), which corresponds to the second and third features. The AGS is a simple game, which encourages drivers to adopt specific active behavior to play the game. Drivers can keep their wakefulness by playing the AGS, while enjoying it, even though false drowsiness alarms may occur. The usefulness of the proposed WKSS was evaluated through experiments using a driving simulator, which suggest that WKSS could be accepted by many drivers and contributing to realizing a zero-traffic-accident society.",

    "abstract": "Driver maneuver prediction is of great importance in designing a modern Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Such predictions can improve driving safety by alerting the driver to the danger of unsafe or risky traffic situations. In this research, we developed a model to predict driver maneuvers, including left/right lane changes, left/right turns and driving straight forward 3.6 seconds on average before they occur in real time. For this, we propose a deep learning method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which utilizes data on the driver's gaze and head position as well as vehicle dynamics data. We applied our approach on real data collected during drives in an urban environment in an instrumented vehicle. In comparison with previous IOHMM techniques that predicted three maneuvers including left/right turns and driving straight, our prediction model is able to anticipate two more maneuvers. In addition to this, our experimental results show that our model using identical dataset improved F1 score by 4% and increased to 84%.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to revolutionize road transportation in terms of safety and efficiency, offering important societal, economic, and environmental benefits. In this work, we harness CAV capabilities, such as seamless connectivity and fine-grained control to safely and efficiently coordinate a set of CAVs crossing an unsignalized intersection. Coordinated control is achieved by generating an acceleration profile for each CAV to simultaneously optimize fuel consumption and travel time. As the resulting problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, we design a novel centralized solution approach. First, we construct a relaxed reformulation of the problem by ignoring certain safety constraints to eliminate interdependence between the trajectories of CAVs traveling in the same lane. Because the relaxed problem is still non-convex, we develop a custom convex-concave procedure that yields the travel time of each CAV to traverse the intersection without lateral collisions. Finally, the derived travel times are utilized to construct collision-free trajectories for all CAVs using convex optimization. Elaborating on principles from the centralized approach, we also introduce a decentralized scheme that solves the problem on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. Extensive simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approaches in terms of solution quality and execution speed. Simulation results also highlight the importance of optimizing the trade-off between travel time and fuel consumption as small sacrifices in travel time lead to substantial fuel savings. Finally, simulation results indicate that the simultaneous coordination of a set of CAVs yields significant performance benefits compared to decentralized control.",

In this paper, a novel algorithm of multi-AUVs task assignment and path planning based on Biologically Inspired Neural Network Map (BINN) is proposed. Firstly, the grid map is built by discretizing the three-dimensional underwater environment into many equal grids. Secondly, the activity values of all AUVs in the BINN maps of each target are calculated. Then, the AUV with the highest activity value in the BINN map of the target is selected as the winning AUV for the target. Finally, the winning AUV performs path planning according to the BINN strategy. Through the simulation experiment, it is proved that the novel BINN algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively and reasonably distribute multi-AUVs and reduce the overall sailing distance.",

The algorithm is based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle by considering the driving mission as an optimal control problem. On a planned route, diverse application cases may occur due to various physical traits such as powertrain (e.g., switching between motor and generator operation), environmental variations (e.g., terrain grade change), traffic laws (e.g., speed limits), and safety concerns (e.g., headway to the leading vehicle). The proposed algorithm handles these real-world challenges by considering the perturbation to the system dynamics and the constraints to the control and state variables.",

    "abstract": "Information flow topology plays a crucial role in the control of connected autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes an approach to search for the Pareto optimal information flow topology off-line for the control of connected vehicles’ platoon using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Based on the obtained Pareto optimal information flow topology, the platoon's overall performance in terms of three main performance indices: tracking index, acceleration standard deviation, and fuel consumption, are all improved. Numerical simulations are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the simulation, the impact of different information flow topologies on the performance of the connected autonomous vehicles platoon is firstly investigated. The results show that more communication links can lead to better tracking ability. The smoothness of the velocity profile is consistent with fuel economy, while velocity profile's smoothness, fuel economy and communication efficiency are in contrary to the tracking index. Then, five cases are discussed using the Pareto optimal information flow topology. The results indicate that while ensuring the platoon's stability, the obtained Pareto optimal information flow topology can improve the tracking ability by 33.67% to 49.35%, and fuel economy by 7.181% to 16.93% and driving comfort up to 14.9%.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a distributed model predictive control strategy for a team of vehicles moving in an unknown obstacle scenario. In particular, we combine receding horizon control arguments with leader-follower formations in order to design a flexible architecture where the vehicle topology, if needed, can be rearranged to better cope with the presence of obstacles. Each vehicle is equipped with an ad-hoc dual-mode controller in charge of tracking along the leader-follower chain the predecessor vehicle (namely the target for the leader) and ensuring absence of collisions. Moreover, whenever the leader recognizes that the obstacle scenario obstructs its navigation, the current formation is properly reconfigured by preserving recursive feasibility and obstacle avoidance properties. Final numerical results on a team of seven point mobile robots are instrumental to show the main features of the proposed distributed model predictive control algorithm.",

    "abstract": "As a good example of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), Advisory Speed Assistance (ASA) helps improve driving safety and possibly energy efficiency by showing advisory speed to the driver of an intelligent vehicle. However, driver-based speed tracking errors often emerge, due to the perception and reaction delay, as well as imperfect vehicle control, degrading the effectiveness of ASA system. In this study, we propose a learning-based approach to modeling driver behavior, aiming to predict and compensate for the speed tracking errors in real time. Subject drivers are first classified into different types according to their driving behaviors using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. A nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network is then adopted to predict the speed tracking errors generated by each driver. A specific traffic scenario has been created in a Unity game engine-based driving simulator platform, where ASA system provides advisory driving speed to the driver via a head-up display (HUD). A human-in-the-loop simulation study is conducted by 17 volunteer drivers, revealing a 53% reduction in the speed error variance and a 3% reduction in the energy consumption with the compensation of the speed tracking errors. The results are further validated by a field implementation with a real passenger vehicle.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic objects have a significant impact on the robot’s perception of the environment which degrades the performance of essential tasks such as localization and mapping. In this work, we address this problem by synthesizing plausible color, texture and geometry in regions occluded by dynamic objects. We propose the novel geometry-aware DynaFill architecture that follows a coarse-to-fine topology and incorporates our gated reccurrent feedback mechanism to adaptively fuse information from previous timesteps. We optimize our architecture using adversarial training to synthesize fine realistic textures which enables it to hallucinate color and depth structure in occluded regions online in a spatially and temporally coherent manner, without relying on future frame information. Casting our inpainting problem as an image-to-image translation task, our model also corrects regions correlated with the presence of dynamic objects in the scene, such as shadows or reflections. We introduce a large-scale hyperrealistic dataset with RGB-D images, semantic segmentation labels, camera poses as well as groundtruth RGB-D information of occluded regions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in challenging weather conditions. Furthermore, we present results for retrieval-based visual localization with the synthesized images that demonstrate the utility of our approach.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2022.3168577",
    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "The electric vehicle (EV) and electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) have been widely deployed with the development of large-scale transportation electrifications. However, since charging behaviors of EVs show large uncertainties, the forecasting of EVCS charging power is non-trivial. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a reinforcement learning assisted deep learning framework for the probabilistic EVCS charging power forecasting to capture its uncertainties. Since the EVCS charging power data are not standard time-series data like electricity load, they are first converted to the time-series format. On this basis, one of the most popular deep learning models, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is used and trained to obtain the point forecast of EVCS charging power. To further capture the forecast uncertainty, a Markov decision process (MDP) is employed to model the change of LSTM cell states, which is solved by our proposed adaptive exploration proximal policy optimization (AePPO) algorithm based on reinforcement learning. Finally, experiments are carried out on the real EVCSs charging data from Caltech, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, USA, respectively. The results and comparative analysis verify the effectiveness and outperformance of our proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Handling of critical situations is an important part in the architecture of an autonomous vehicle. A controller for autonomous collision avoidance is developed based on a wary strategy that assumes the least tire-road friction for which the maneuver is still feasible. Should the friction be greater, the controller makes use of this, and performs better. The controller uses an acceleration-vector reference obtained from optimal control of a friction-limited particle, whose applicability is verified by using numerical optimization on a full vehicle model. By employing an analytical tire model of the tire-road friction limit, to determine slip references for steering, and body-slip control, the result is a controller where the computation of its output is explicit, and independent of the actual tire-road friction. When evaluated in real-time on a high-fidelity simulation model, the developed controller performs close to that achieved by offline numerical optimization.",

We present a decentralized, two-level optimal framework to coordinate the platoons with the objective to minimize travel delay and fuel consumption of every platoon crossing the intersection. At the upper-level, each platoon leader derives a proven optimal schedule to enter the intersection. At the low-level, the platoon leader derives their optimal control input (acceleration/deceleration) for the optimal schedule derived in the upper-level. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in simulation and show significant improvements both in travel delay and fuel consumption compared to the baseline scenarios where platoons enter the intersection based on first-come-first-serve and longest queue first - maximum weight matching scheduling algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Precise localization is essential but also challenging for autonomous vehicles. In this article, A novel visual localization method is proposed. Specifically, a semantic local map describing the local environment is built with images sequence and wheel-inertial ego-motion results. Then the local semantic map is matched with the online map database for camera position estimation. The key novelty of the method lies in using a supervised neural network to simplify the map-matching problem, which avoids the complex data association and optimization processes. The network encodes the maps, infers the feature similarity, and predicts the camera position. The visual localization results are then loosely integrated with other onboard sensors by an invariant Kalman filter. We evaluate the map-matching module and the overall fusion system on scenario tests. The experiment results validate the effectiveness of the learning-based map-matching method. And the accuracy of the overall system is satisfactory, with mean absolute errors of 0.039 m and 0.167 m in the lateral and longitudinal directions, respectively.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a unified mathematical definition for describing commonly used terms encountered in systematical analysis of automated driving systems in mixed-traffic simulations. The most significant contribution of this work is in translating the terms that are clarified previously in literature into a mathematical set and function based format. Our work can be seen as an incremental step towards further formalisation of Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) for scenario representation. We also extended the previous work in the literature to allow more complex scenarios by expanding the model-incompliant information using set-theory to represent the perception capacity of the road-user agents. With this dynamic perception definition, we also support interactive scenarios and are not limited to reactive and pre-defined agent behavior. Our main focus is to give a framework to represent realistic road-user behavior to be used in simulation or computational tool to examine interaction patterns in mixed-traffic conditions. We believe that, by formalising the verbose definitions and extending theprevious work in DSL, we can support automatic scenario generation and dynamic/evolving agent behavior models for simulating mixed traffic situations and scenarios. In addition, we can obtain scenarios that are realistic but also can represent rare-conditions that are difficult to extract from field-tests and real driving data repositories.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twin, as an emerging technology related to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT), has attracted increasing attentions during the past decade. Conceptually, a Digital Twin is a digital replica of a physical entity in the real world, and this technology is leveraged in this study to design a cooperative driving system at non-signalized intersections, allowing connected vehicles to cooperate with each other to cross intersections without any full stops. Within the proposed Digital Twin framework, we developed an enhanced first-in-first-out (FIFO) slot reservation algorithm to schedule the sequence of crossing vehicles, a consensus motion control algorithm to calculate vehicles’ referenced longitudinal motion, and a model-based motion estimation algorithm to tackle communication delay and packet loss. Additionally, an augmented reality (AR) human-machine-interface (HMI) is designed to provide the guidance to drivers to cooperate with other connected vehicles. Agent-based modeling and simulation of the proposed system is conducted in Unity game engine based on a real-world map in San Francisco, and the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation results prove the benefits of the proposed algorithms with 20% reduction in travel time and 23.7% reduction in energy consumption, respectively, when compared with traditional signalized intersections.",

    "abstract": "A tractor-trailer system is an underactuated system that is subject to nonholonomic constraints and exhibits extremely nonlinear behaviors. Its trajectory planning and control issues remain widely researched. In this paper, on the basis of establishing a precise kinematic model, a novel method is proposed to realize autonomous motion control of an off-axle hitching tractor-trailer system with a drawbar. The proposed method is roughly divided into three steps: EXTRACTING (E) a virtual subsystem, trajectory PLANNING (P) for the original full system, and trajectory TRACKING (T) by feedback control techniques, thus the “EPT method”. In the E step, two alternative strategies are considered to construct a virtual subsystem by extracting a part of an original towed aircraft system. Then, in the P step, a two-layer optimal control-based method is developed to generate a reference trajectory. A trajectory for the virtual subsystem is generated in the first layer, where the Reeds-Shepp curve with artificial expertise in selecting intermediate nodes is introduced to provide initial guesses. The results obtained in the first layer are utilized to initialize partial state and control variables in the trajectory planning for the original full system in the second layer. Finally, in the T step, a receding horizon controller is designed to drive the carrier aircraft to track the reference trajectory under various external disturbances. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the EPT method is applicable and highly efficient. The proposed method is also applicable for generalized tractor-trailer systems and other chain-link systems.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle racing has emerged as vibrant, innovative technology development, demonstration platform in recent years. Universities, companies demonstrate their achievements on various vehicles - from 1:10th to full-scale prototypes. One of those platforms is the Dallara AV-21, and the spec-vehicle for the Indy Autonomous Challenge. This paper outlines the robust model predictive control (MPC) concept used within the software stack of the TUM Autonomous Motorsport team. It is based on a simplified friction-limited point mass model and a set of low-level feedback controllers. The remaining model uncertainties are managed via introducing a constraint-tightening approach based on a Tube-MPC approach. In contrast to classical tracking controllers, the optimization problem is formulated to freely optimize the trajectory while staying within certain maximum deviations of the reference. This approach allows to rely on a coarse output of the trajectory planning approach while maintaining smoothness requirements in steering, throttle, and brake actuation. The paper highlights the advantages of the proposed robust reoptimization concept compared to pure tracking formulations. It showcases the performance compared to a classical LQR controller and an MPC, which utilizes a vehicle model with a more sophisticated tire model. The controller achieved a top speed of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{265 kmh}^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n and lateral accelerations up to \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\text{21 ms}}^{-2}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n during a two-vehicle competition involving dynamic overtaking maneuvers on the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, a famous racetrack with turns banked up to \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$20^{\\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n.",

    "abstract": "Steering control for autonomous vehicles at high speeds is challenging due to the highly nonlinear vehicle dynamics. The traditional model-based controllers usually degrade significantly in this case. With the development of artificial intelligence, learning-based control methods are emerging as promising alternatives. These methods require a tremendous amount of training data to achieve acceptable performances. However, the data collection process is costly or inefficient. To solve this problem, we propose a parallel learning-based steering control method. Specifically, we first build a neural network (NN) based trajectory generative model (GeneratingNN) based on limited steering-trajectory raw data. The GeneratingNN can efficiently generate sufficient steering-trajectory data by enumerating the allowable steering actions sequences. Then, based on the raw data and generated data, we train another NN (RecallingNN) to learn the inverse mapping relationship between steering actions and trajectories. Hence, the RecallingNN can efficiently recall appropriate steering actions once given the previewed trajectory points. In addition, to further enhance the control accuracy and robustness, we use a simple feedback controller to handle the unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. Testing results validate that the proposed method can achieve better tracking accuracy, stability and computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of intelligent vehicles and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), a new trend is that mixed levels of human driver engagements will be involved in the transportation system. Therefore, necessary visual guidance for drivers is vitally important under this situation to prevent potential risks. To advance the development of visual guidance systems, we introduce a novel vision-cloud data fusion methodology, integrating camera image and Digital Twin information from the cloud to help intelligent vehicles make better decisions. Target vehicle bounding box is drawn and matched with the help of the object detector (running on the ego-vehicle) and position information (received from the cloud). The best matching result, a 79.2% accuracy under 0.7 intersection over union threshold, is obtained with depth images served as an additional feature source. A case study on lane change prediction is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed data fusion methodology. In the case study, a multi-layer perceptron algorithm is proposed with modified lane change prediction approaches. Human-in-the-loop simulation results obtained from the Unity game engine reveal that the proposed model can improve highway driving performance significantly in terms of safety, comfort, and environmental sustainability.",

    "abstract": "The Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA) is the main unit of motion simulators responsible for transforming the vehicle motions to generate driving motion sensation for the simulator users within the motion simulator's physical workspace through washout filters. In this study, we design and provide a new framework by developing a set of novel washout filters using optimized fuzzy control systems to solve the drawbacks associated with the existing optimal MCAs of the motion simulators. These drawbacks include constant washout filter parameters, inefficient simulator movement in the workspace, lack of considering the simulator's physical constraints and driver sensation-related factors, and sub-optimal settings which causes false motion cues and subsequently simulator sickness. As a pioneering framework, the fuzzy logic controllers generate restitution signals for the optimal washout filters based on the motion sensation error between the real vehicle and simulator divers as well as the platform's position in the workspace aiming to correct the filtered signals, reduce error, generate realistic motions, and increase motion fidelity online. The GA is applied to optimize the fuzzy logic membership functions and control rules. The optimization procedure takes into account a number of important factors that are normally ignored in the current MCAs including the sensed motion error between the drivers of simulator and real car; the platform physical constraints; the motion threshold limiter effects; and signal shape following. The new adaptive MCA is designed, implemented and tested using the MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the developed MCA in maximizing motion fidelity and the reference sensation shape following, and enhancing the workspace usage of the simulator.",

    "abstract": "Predicting vulnerableroad user behavior is an essential prerequisite for deploying Automated Driving Systems (ADS) in the real-world. Pedestrian crossing intention should be recognized in real-time, especially for urban driving. Recent works have shown the potential of using vision-based deep neural network models for this task. However, these models are not robust and certain issues still need to be resolved. First, the global spatio-temporal context that accounts for the interaction between the target pedestrian and the scene has not been properly utilized. Second, the optimal strategy for fusing different sensor data has not been thoroughly investigated. This work addresses the above limitations by introducing a novel neural network architecture to fuse inherently different spatio-temporal features for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. We fuse different phenomena such as sequences of RGB imagery, semantic segmentation masks, and ego-vehicle speed in an optimal way using attention mechanisms and a stack of recurrent neural networks. The optimal architecture was obtained through exhaustive ablation and comparison studies. Extensive comparative experiments on the JAAD and PIE pedestrian action prediction benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, where state-of-the-art performance was achieved.

    "abstract": "As a non-invasive method, vision-based driver monitoring aims to identify risky maneuvers for intelligent vehicles and it has gained an increasing interest over recent years. However, most existing methods tend to design models for specific tasks, such as head pose or gaze estimation, which results in redundant models hampering real time applications. Besides, most driver facial monitoring methods ignore the correlation of different tasks. In this work, we propose a unified framework based on cascade learning for simultaneous facial landmark detection and head pose estimation, as well as simultaneous eye center detection and gaze estimation. In particular, built upon the key idea that facial landmark locations and 3D face model parameters are implicitly correlated, we introduce a cascade regression framework to achieve these two tasks simultaneously. After coarsely extracting the driver’s eye region from the detected facial landmarks, we perform cascade regression for simultaneous eye center detection and gaze estimation. Leveraging the power of cascade learning allows our method to alternatively optimize facial landmark detection, head pose estimation, eye center localization, and gaze prediction. The comparison experiments conducted on benchmark datasets of 300-W, GI4E, BU, MPIIGaze, and driving dataset of SHRP2 demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance with robust effectiveness on the real driver monitoring applications.",

The algorithm consists of two parts: a neural network-based algorithm that deducts the shortest path and avoids all possible collisions; and an adjusting component that balances off the deviation brought by the effect of ocean currents. The optimization results of the proposed algorithm are presented in details, and compared with the path planning algorithm that does not consider the effect of currents. Results of the comparison prove the effectiveness of the path planning method when encountering currents of different directions and velocities.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a less-disturbed ecological driving strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The proposed strategy integrates the offline planning and the online tracking. In offline planning, an energy efficient reference speed is created based on traffic information (such as the average traffic speed) and characteristics of the vehicle (such as the engine efficiency map) via dynamic programming. The consideration of average traffic speed in speed planning avoids selfish optimisations. In online tracking, model predictive control is employed to update the vehicle speed in real-time to track the reference speed. A key challenge in applying ecological driving strategies in real driving is that the vehicle has to consider other traffic participants when tracking the reference speed. Therefore, this paper combines both longitudinal control and lateral control to achieve better speed tracking by overtaking the preceding vehicle when necessary. The proposed less-disturbed ecological driving strategy has been evaluated in simulations in both single road segment scenario and real traffic environment. Comparisons of the proposed method with benchmark strategies and human drivers are made. The results demonstrate that the proposed less-disturbed ecological driving strategy is more effective in energy saving. Compared to human drivers, the less-disturbed eco-driving strategy improves the fuel efficiency of CAVs by 4.53%.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Semi-autonomous vehicles equipped with assistive control systems may experience degraded lateral behaviors when aggressive driver steering commands compete with high levels of autonomy. This challenge can be mitigated with effective operator intent recognition, which can configure automated systems in context-specific situations where the driver intends to perform a steering maneuver. In this article, an ensemble learning-based driver intent recognition strategy has been developed. A nonlinear model predictive control algorithm has been designed and implemented to generate haptic feedback for lateral vehicle guidance, assisting the drivers in accomplishing their intended action. To validate the framework, operator-in-the-loop testing with 30 human subjects was conducted on a steer-by-wire platform with a virtual reality driving environment. The roadway scenarios included lane change, obstacle avoidance, intersection turns, and highway exit. The automated system with learning-based driver intent recognition was compared to both the automated system with a finite state machine-based driver intent estimator and the automated system without any driver intent prediction for all driving events. Test results demonstrate that semi-autonomous vehicle performance can be enhanced by up to 74.1% with a learning-based intent predictor. Further, the learning-based model has a 30.9% higher driver intent recognition accuracy than the finite state machine-based method. The holistic framework that integrates human intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and vehicle control can help solve the driver-system conflict problem leading to safer operation.",

    "publication_date": "June 2022",
    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection, with the aim of predicting the geometric properties of on-road objects, is a promising research topic for the intelligent perception systems of autonomous driving. Most state-of-the-art methods follow a keypoint-based paradigm, where the keypoints of objects are predicted and employed as the basis for regressing the other geometric properties. In this work, a unified network named as FADNet is presented to address the task of monocular 3D object detection. In contrast to previous keypoint-based methods, we propose to divide the output modalities into different groups according to the estimation difficulty of object properties. Different groups are treated differently and sequentially associated by a convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit. Another contribution of this work is the strategy of depth hint augmentation. To provide characterized depth patterns as hints for depth estimation, a dedicated depth hint module is designed to generate row-wise features named as depth hints, which are explicitly supervised in a bin-wise manner. The contributions of this work are validated by conducting experiments and ablation study on the KITTI benchmark. Without utilizing depth priors, post optimization, or other refinement modules, our network performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a decent running speed.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Pedestrians will increasingly have to share their space with autonomous vehicles (AVs), at pedestrian crossings, and in urban shared spaces where segregation between pedestrians and vehicles is minimized. This article proposes an integrative framework to analyze pedestrian behavior in shared spaces with AVs. Following the “perception-cognition-action” cycle, the proposed framework breaks down pedestrian behavior into 3 parts: 1. Sensation and Perception; 2. Emotion and Cognition; 3. Action and Communication. The framework is used to review and synthesize current knowledge on pedestrian behavior in urban shared spaces. Studies involving pedestrians in shared environments with AVs are limited. Since an AV can be seen as a hybrid of a conventional car and a mobile robot, this review includes studies on pedestrian behavior with conventional cars and with mobile robots as well as with AVs. Examining pedestrian behavior in these three situations of interaction allows us to make assumptions about how humans will behave in sharing their urban spaces with AVs. The reviewed interactions reveal that pedestrians have diverse and imperfect behaviors. AVs must consider this variety of behaviors and follow socially compliant rules in order to be understood and accepted by pedestrians. Perspectives for AVs in shared spaces and research directions are also identified.",

However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, all of the existing works address only constant or time-varying constraint functions. In this work, we study \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">path-dependent</i>\n constraint requirements, which explicitly depend on the path parameter, instead of depending on the time variable directly. This approach is more practical in reality, where the constraint requirements are often shaped by the environment boundaries. From the system users’ perspectives, it is also much easier to define constraint functions based on the path parameter. A modified version of the universal barrier function is used in the analysis of path-dependent constraint requirements. We show that under the proposed novel control scheme, the vehicle’s line-of-sight distance and angle error terms can converge into small sets near the equilibrium with a fixed-time convergence rate, while the path-dependent constraint requirements are satisfied at all time. A simulation and an experiment study further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, collision avoidance has become a research hotspot since it has the potential to increase safety. To obtain a collision-free path, the artificial potential field (APF) is widely used as a path planning method. APF is capable of establishing functional relationships between the vehicle and surrounding objects. However, the function features of the traditional APF method can cause autonomous vehicles to fall into the local minimum, and the generated zigzag path may be difficult to follow. Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a real-time path planning method for autonomous vehicles using the dynamic enhanced firework algorithm-APF. Firstly, to improve the safety and smoothness of the planned path by the traditional APF method, the constraints of the vehicle dynamics and different types of obstacles are taken into consideration. Secondly, an optimization problem is formulated to find an optimal path with the least cost in the driving area. Finally, the proposed method is verified with both a simulation and a hardware-in-loop test environment. The results show that the studied autonomous vehicle successfully avoids obstacles and arrives at the goal position by using the proposed path-planning method, and the path smoothness is improved.",

This paper contributes to the field of ecodriving control by developing a novel approach capable to deal with curvy roads, combining road grade and curvature look ahead to keep the driving comfortable, while also considering pollutant emissions. The formulation and solution of emission aware ecodriving as an optimal control problem is presented and, more specifically, a novel switching Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is proposed. Its feasibility and potential are shown by means of simulation case studies based on real world test cases, a validated vehicle model, and measured road topology. Hence, it is shown that emission aware ecodriving is a viable option and that developers of future ecodriving systems should expand their focus from solely energy efficiency towards additional targets.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory planning is commonly used as part of a local planner in autonomous driving. This paper considers the problem of planning a continuous-curvature-rate trajectory between fixed start and goal states that minimizes a tunable trade-off between passenger comfort and travel time. The problem is an instance of infinite dimensional optimization over two continuous functions: a path and a velocity profile. We propose a simplification of this problem that facilitates the discretization of both functions. This paper also proposes a method to quickly generate minimal-length paths between start and goal states based on a single tuning parameter: the second derivative of curvature. Further, we discretize the set of velocity profiles along a given path into a selection of longitudinal jerk way-points along the path. Finally, we repeatedly solve the path and velocity profiles in an iterative fashion. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the benefits of the proposed methods.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2022.3145035",
    "publication_date": "June 2022",
    "abstract": "Long-tail effect, characterized by highly frequent occurrence of normal scenarios and the scarce appearance of extreme “long-tail” scenarios, ubiquitously exists in the vision-related problems in the real-world applications. Though many computer vision methods to date have already achieved feasible performance for most of the normal scenarios, it is still challenging for existing vision systems to accurately perceive the long-tail scenarios. This deficiency largely hinders the practical application of computer vision systems, since long-tail problems may incur fatal consequences, such as traffic accidents, taking the vision systems of autonomous vehicles as an example. In this paper, we firstly propose a theoretical framework named Long-tail Regularization (LoTR), for analyzing and tackling the long-tail problems in the vision perception of autonomous driving. LoTR is able to regularize the scarcely occurred long-tail scenarios to be frequently encountered. Then we present a Parallel Vision Actualization System (PVAS), which consists of closed-loop optimization and virtual-real interaction, to search for challenging long-tail scenarios and produce large-scale long-tail driving scenarios for autonomous vehicles. In addition, we introduce how to perform PVAS in Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge of China (IVFC), the most durable autonomous driving competition around the world. Results over the past decade demonstrate that PVAS can effectively guide the collection of long-tail data to diminish the cost in the real world, and thus promote the capability of vision systems to adapt to complex environments, alleviating the impact of long-tail effect.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Within the field of automated driving, a clear trend in environment perception tends towards more sensors, higher redundancy, and overall increase in computational power. This is mainly driven by the paradigm to perceive the entire environment as best as possible at all times. However, due to the ongoing rise in functional complexity, compromises have to be considered to ensure real-time capabilities of the perception system. In this work, we introduce a concept for situation-aware environment perception to control the resource allocation towards processing relevant areas within the data as well as towards employing only a subset of functional modules for environment perception, if sufficient for the current driving task. Specifically, we propose to evaluate the context of an automated vehicle to derive a multi-layer attention map (MLAM) that defines relevant areas. Using this MLAM, the optimum of active functional modules is dynamically configured and intra-module processing of only relevant data is enforced. We outline the feasibility of application of our concept using real-world data in a straight-forward implementation for our system at hand. While retaining overall functionality, we achieve a reduction of accumulated processing time of 59 %.",

    "publication_date": "June 2022",
    "abstract": "The development of new assessment methods for the performance of automated vehicles is essential to enable the deployment of automated driving technologies, due to the complex operational domain of automated vehicles. One contributing method is scenario-based assessment in which test cases are derived from real-world road traffic scenarios obtained from driving data. Given the complexity of the reality that is being modeled in these scenarios, it is a challenge to define a structure for capturing these scenarios. An intensional definition that provides a set of characteristics that are deemed to be both necessary and sufficient to qualify as a scenario assures that the scenarios constructed are both complete and intercomparable. In this article, we develop a comprehensive and operable definition of the notion of scenario while considering existing definitions in the literature. This is achieved by proposing an object-oriented framework in which scenarios and their building blocks are defined as classes of objects having attributes, methods, and relationships with other objects. The object-oriented approach promotes clarity, modularity, reusability, and encapsulation of the objects. We provide definitions and justifications of each of the terms. Furthermore, the framework is used to translate the terms in a coding language that is publicly available.",

    "publication_date": "June 2022",
    "abstract": "Backlash phenomena have haunted control engineers for ages. Concerning the ground vehicle path-tracking control system design, the steering system's backlash attribute is often overlooked. If not properly compensated, the backlash nonlinearity tends to provoke unfavorable consequences including erroneous positioning of the road-wheel steering angle, response chattering, limit-cycle-like oscillations, and delays. This paper pioneers to employ an adaptive inverse controller to offset the dynamics of the steering system's backlash. Overall, the path-following objective is accomplished via a novel trio-loop control architecture, which decomposes the tracking objectives into kinematic, vehicular lateral dynamics, and steering backlash compensation sub-levels. All adaptive control laws are robustified by means of sigma modification. Hardware-in-the-loop experimental results are presented to demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed solution.",

    "abstract": "Automated vehicles offer various benefits for private transport. Besides an increase in road safety and driving comfort, higher levels of automated driving provide the opportunity to perform non-driving related tasks and to save time. Fundamental requirements for the success of automated driving are an appropriate tactical decision-making of the automation system and accepted automated driving styles. For this reason, this article focuses on the assessment of automated driving styles with different lane change frequencies and the potential influence of non-driving related tasks. A driving study (\n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n = 60) was conducted on a German highway under real-world conditions using a vehicle with a prototype automation system. The evaluation of automated driving styles and driving experience of participants was based on well-being, driving comfort, trust in automation, and acceptance of the automation system. The study did not reveal any statistically significant interactions between three non-driving related tasks and two automated driving styles with a low and a high lane change frequency. However, the driving style with a low lane change frequency resulted in significantly more discomfort than the driving style with a high lane change frequency. Furthermore, the authors confirmed the assumption that intentions of an automated drive and external circumstances, such as time pressure or specific driving scenarios, affect the preferred lane change frequency.",

    "abstract": "A crucial and challenging issue in autonomous driving is dynamic road environment detection and 3D multi object tracking. In this article, we propose a novel framework for online 3D multi-object tracking to eliminate the influence of inherent uncertainty and unknown biases in point cloud. A constant turn rate and velocity (CTRV) motion model is employed to estimate the future motion state, which are smoothed by a cubature Kalman filter (CKF) algorithm. A new affinity model is introduced to evaluate the similarity between trajectories and candidate detections for accurate and reliable data association which can be formulated as a bipartite matching problem. An adaptive cubature Kalman filter (ACKF) is given to remove the influence of unknown bias and to robustly update the tracked state. Accuracy and speed of the proposed tracking method are evaluated on the KITTI 3D multi-object tracking dataset, showing superior performance than the baselines.",

    "publication_date": "June 2022",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) concept has evolved significantly. ADAS involves several technologies such as automotive electronics, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, RADAR, LIDAR, computer vision, and machine learning. Of these, \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">computer vision</i>\n and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">machine learning</i>\n based solutions have mainly been effective that have allowed real-time vehicle control, driver aided systems, etc. However, most of the existing works deal with the deployment of ADAS and autonomous driving functionality in countries with well-disciplined lane traffic. Nevertheless, these solutions and frameworks do not work in countries and cities with less-disciplined/chaotic traffic. This paper identifies the research gaps, reviews the state-of-the-art looking at the different functionalities of ADAS and its levels of autonomy. Importantly, it provides a detailed description of vision intelligence and computational intelligence for ADAS. The eye-gaze and head pose estimation in vision intelligence is detailed. Notably, the learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning and deep learning solutions for ADAS are considered and discussed. Significantly, this would enable developing a real-time recommendation system for system-assisted/autonomous vehicular environments with less-disciplined road traffic.",

    "abstract": "The text records of urban rail transit operation emergencies contain information about the relationship between events, which can provide auxiliary support for emergency decision-making. However, most of the current text records of urban rail transit operation emergencies are unstructured data, which makes it difficult to extract the correlation of events directly. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective approach to extract the event relations from the text records of urban rail transit operation emergencies by using natural language processing technology. Since the research object of this paper is Chinese semantics, the characteristics of the Chinese language are considered to make a better performance. Specifically, since the shortcomings of insufficient information representation and single perspectives in the expression of word vector, this paper combines Chinese word vector with Chinese character vector to obtain the information of the text data from different levels. Then, the obtained information is input into the bidirectional long short-term memory neural network-attention mechanism model (BiLSTM-Attention), which makes the overall and local features of the text can be simultaneously extracted. Finally, the experiments illustrate the model BiLSTM-Attention proposed in this paper can effectively and accurately extract the relationship between events, which provides an effective reference for emergency decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Automatic vehicle following and cruising under all road geometry characteristics (curvature, slope, and superelevation) and traffic conditions without putting the vehicle occupants or other vehicles in unsafe situations are fundamental for the success of autonomous vehicles. Despite the advances in sensor technologies, we do not have the accuracy needed to guarantee safety under all driving conditions. In fact, for certain road geometries such as going around sharp curves, forward-looking beams and vision cannot see what is around the curve no matter how accurate they are. To ensure safety and driving comfort, the following challenges need to be addressed under all road geometry characteristics and traffic conditions: Effective detection of in-path objects, collision avoidance with objects not visible with exteroceptive sensors, adopting a cautious approach in high noise environment and avoiding high longitudinal and lateral accelerations for driving comfort. This paper presents a methodology and control design that meets these challenges. It incorporates geo-referenced maps to identify road geometries and detect in-path objects. It analyses the impact of noise on sensor data and uses a probabilistic approach to determine the desired velocity. It then proposes a vehicle following controller that achieves robust vehicle following and cruising under all road geometries and in particular sharp curves. In the case of sharp curves, where a possible obstacle is not visible by the on-board sensors, slowing down to a certain speed preemptively to have time to stop is part of the proposed methodology. Simulations show that proposed system fulfills all safety and comfort constraints.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the cooperative target tracking of under-actuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with event-triggered communications subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The target position information can be sensed by a fraction of follower USVs only. A fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture is presented for achieving cooperative target tracking under DoS attacks. Specifically, a distributed edge-triggered fixed-time extended state observer (ESO) is designed to recover the position and velocity of the target with a prescribed time regardless of the unreliable communication network subject to DoS attacks. Moreover, the communication burden of the network is reduced by the proposed edge-triggered mechanism. In the control law design, a fixed-time ESO is designed for estimating the model uncertainties and external disturbances in an earth-fixed reference frame. Then, a fixed-time target tracking control law is proposed for each follower USV based on the fixed-time ESO. It is proven that the error signals in the closed-loop control system of USVs are convergent to the origin in a fixed time. An example is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time resilient cooperative edge-triggered estimation and control architecture for USVs.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an optimization-based approach for safe, efficient, and resilient autonomous intersection traffic control in realistic vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication environment. The proposed framework produces the fastest discrete-time trajectory for vehicles who want to cross an intersection. Constraints for safety are designed carefully in the optimization problem formulation to prevent potential collisions during intersection crossings. A novel vehicle-to-intersection (V2I) interaction mechanism is designed to handle imperfect communication characteristics such as packet delivery delay and loss. The proposed intersection management framework is evaluated by running extensive simulations using an open source vehicular network and microscopic traffic simulation software, Veins. The results show that the overall traffic control performance of the proposed framework is substantially better than conventional traffic light control framework, in particular when traffic volume is light and medium, even in situations with a realistic wireless vehicular network setting where packet delivery delays and drops occasionally occur.",

    "abstract": "Focusing on the task of point-to-point navigation for an autonomous driving vehicle, we propose a novel deep learning model trained with end-to-end and multi-task learning manners to perform both perception and control tasks simultaneously. The model is used to drive the ego vehicle safely by following a sequence of routes defined by the global planner. The perception part of the model is used to encode high-dimensional observation data provided by an RGBD camera while performing semantic segmentation, semantic depth cloud (SDC) mapping, and traffic light state and stop sign prediction. Then, the control part decodes the encoded features along with additional information provided by GPS and speedometer to predict waypoints that come with a latent feature space. Furthermore, two agents are employed to process these outputs and make a control policy that determines the level of steering, throttle, and brake as the final action. The model is evaluated on CARLA simulator with various scenarios made of normal-adversarial situations and different weathers to mimic real-world conditions. In addition, we do a comparative study with some recent models to justify the performance in multiple aspects of driving. Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study on SDC mapping and multi-agent to understand their roles and behavior. As a result, our model achieves the highest driving score even with fewer parameters and computation load.

    "abstract": "With the development of automatic driving technology and the internet of vehicles, platooning based on control of connected autonomous vehicles has become one of the most promising approaches to improve traffic efficiency. This paper studies the control problem of mixed vehicle platoons consisting of human-driven vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles. Firstly, we propose a data-driven method to model mixed vehicle platoons based on Koopman operator theory. This method gives a way to represent the mixed vehicle platoon by a linear model in a high-dimensional space, the approximation of which is obtained by a neural network framework. Secondly, we employ model predictive control (MPC) to address the platoon control problem of mixed vehicle platoons, where both centralized MPC and distributed MPC algorithms are designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the data-driven modeling method and the centralized/distributed MPC algorithms is verified by numerical simulations. It is revealed that the proposed data-driven DMPC algorithm exhibits comparable control performance with less computation cost compared with the centralized MPC algorithm, and it shows faster convergence speed than the nonlinear model based DMPC algorithm.",

    "abstract": "A driver’s gaze is critical for determining theirattention, state, situational awareness, and readiness to take over control from partially automated vehicles. Estimating the gaze direction is the most obvious way to gauge a driver’s state under ideal conditions when limited to using non-intrusive imaging sensors. Unfortunately, the vehicular environment introduces a variety of challenges that are usually unaccounted for - harsh illumination, nighttime conditions, and reflective eyeglasses. Relying on head pose alone under such conditions can prove to be unreliable and erroneous. In this study, we offer solutions to address these problems encountered in the real world. To solve issues with lighting, we demonstrate that using an infrared camera with suitable equalization and normalization suffices. To handle eyeglasses and their corresponding artifacts, we adopt image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks to pre-process images prior to gaze estimation. Our proposed Gaze Preserving CycleGAN (GPCycleGAN) is trained to preserve the driver’s gaze while removing potential eyeglasses from face images. GPCycleGAN is based on the well-known CycleGAN approach - with the addition of a gaze classifier and a gaze consistency loss for additional supervision. Our approach exhibits improved performance, interpretability, robustness and superior qualitative results on challenging real-world datasets.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Accurate knowledge about the motion state of preceding vehicles (PVs) contributes to the optimization of planning and decision making of autonomous vehicles, which in turn further enhances road safety. Existing studies generally rely on information from special sensors mounted on the ego vehicle to estimate PVs state. With the evolution of information technology, the use of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to estimate the PVs state has attracted more and more attention. However, the problem of how to reduce the communication rate while ensuring the estimation accuracy of PVs state with the limited communication bandwidth has not been addressed yet. In addition, traditional studies on lateral state estimation of PVs assume that the longitudinal velocity of the PV is known or design an additional estimator to predict the longitudinal velocity. This results in the dynamical coupling characteristics of the vehicle not being fully considered. To address these problems, an event-triggered estimation framework by fusing an event-triggered mechanism with an embedded cubature Kalman filter based on a coupled vehicle model is proposed for PVs state estimation. Simulation and real vehicle test results demonstrate that the proposed prediction approach can strike an effective balance between the communication rate and the estimation performance. The estimation accuracy of the proposed method is still superior to that of the cubature Kalman filter, even if the communication rate drops to 37.55%.",

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently been applied to eco-driving to intelligently reduce fuel consumption and travel time. While previous studies synthesize simulators and model-free DRL (MFDRL), this work proposes a Safe Off-policy Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (SMORL) algorithm for eco-driving. SMORL integrates three key components, namely a computationally efficient model-based trajectory optimizer, a value function learned off-policy and a learned safe set. The advantages over the existing literature are three-fold. First, the combination of off-policy learning and the use of a physics-based model improves the sample efficiency. Second, the training does not require any extrinsic rewarding mechanism for constraint satisfaction. Third, the feasibility of trajectory is guaranteed by using a safe set approximated by deep generative models. The performance of SMORL is benchmarked over 100 trips against a baseline controller representing human drivers, a non-learning-based optimal controller, a previously designed MFDRL strategy, and the wait-and-see optimal solution. In simulation, SMORL reduces the fuel consumption by more than 21% while keeping the average speed comparable while compared to the baseline controller and demonstrates a better fuel economy while driving faster compared to the MFDRL agent and the non-learning-based optimal controller.",

    "abstract": "Traffic object detection and recognition systems play an essential role in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV). In this research, we focus on four important classes of traffic objects: traffic signs, road vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights. We first review the major traditional machine learning and deep learning methods that have been used in the literature to detect and recognize these objects. We provide a vision-based framework that detects and recognizes traffic objects inside and outside the attentional visual area of drivers. This approach uses the driver 3D absolute coordinates of the gaze point obtained by the combined, cross-calibrated use of a front-view stereo imaging system and a non-contact 3D gaze tracker. A combination of multi-scale HOG-SVM and Faster R-CNN-based models are utilized in the detection stage. The recognition stage is performed with a ResNet-101 network to verify sets of generated hypotheses. We applied our approach on real data collected during drives in an urban environment with the RoadLAB instrumented vehicle. Our framework achieved 91% of correct object detections and provided promising results in the object recognition stage.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving demands robust and precise vehicle localization in complex environments with limited on-board computational resources. Incorporating reliable semantic information with localization algorithms can increase accuracy remarkably, however, the process of extracting semantic information from LiDAR point clouds and matching it to semantic maps is computationally intensive. Moreover, pure semantic localization cannot achieve the robustness requirements for safe self-driving as the necessary quantity of semantic landmarks cannot be guaranteed under extreme conditions. In this paper, we present a lightweight semantic-aided localization method that improves upon traditional techniques in two ways. First, we propose a highly efficient pipeline to extract three semantic classes from a LiDAR scan. Second, instead of semantic 3D point cloud registration, map matching is performed through 2D key point matching. We then integrate these two functions into a dynamic semantic aided localization framework. Our on-road experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves both the high accuracy of semantic localization and the robustness of non-semantic localization. With our algorithm consuming under 10% of CPU resources, we observe reduced positioning error, especially peak error, when comparing to non-semantic counterparts.",

    "abstract": "The performance of smart vehicle (SV) applications like autonomous driving and in-vehicle augmented reality based traffic information system depends on the Field of View (FoV) and the timely processing of the SVs sensor data. Vehicular networking (VN) technology can enhance the performance of these applications by enabling a SV to access the sensing and processing capabilities of other neighbouring SVs. The processing and storage capacity of a SV is limited compared to cloud servers and the communication link between two SVs is unreliable due to their mobility and the nature of wireless channels. Hence, developing efficient processing and sensing schemes for SVs and VNs can help in optimizing the performance of SV applications. In this paper, we propose Contextual Bandits (CB), Markov decision process (MDP) and deep Q-network (DQN) based sensing and processing schemes for VNs. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes outperform the baseline schemes in a variety of scenarios.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in traffic networks is driving under safety and limited physical space constraints. In this paper, we design longitudinal vehicle controllers and study the dynamics of a system of homogeneous vehicles on a single-lane ring road in order to understand the interplay of limited space, speed, and safety. Each vehicle in the system either operates in the cruise control mode or follows a vehicle ahead by keeping a safe time headway. We show that if the number of vehicles is less than a certain critical threshold, vehicles can occupy the limited space in many different configurations, i.e., different platoons of different sizes, and they converge to a uniform maximum speed while attenuating errors in the relative spacing upstream a platoon. If the number of vehicles exceeds the threshold, vehicles converge to a unique symmetric configuration and the equilibrium speed decreases as the number of vehicles increases. Next, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and show that it increases the critical number of vehicles that can travel with the maximum speed. Finally, we consider vehicle coordination and show that the proposed controllers can force vehicles to converge to a desired configuration specified by the coordinator while maintaining safety and comfort. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed controllers via simulation.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an improved machine learning approach for the accurate and robust state of charge (SOC) in electric vehicle (EV) batteries using differential search optimized random forest regression (RFR) algorithm. The precise SOC estimation confirms the safety and reliability of EV. Nevertheless, SOC is influenced by numerous factors which cannot be measured directly. RFR is suitable for real-time SOC estimation due to its robustness to noise, overfitting issues and capacity to work with huge datasets. However, proper selection of RFR architecture and hyper-parameters combination remains a key issue to be explored. Hence, a differential search algorithm (DSA) is employed to search for the optimal values of trees and leaves in the RFR algorithm. DSA optimized RFR eliminates the utilization of the filter in data pre-processing steps and does not require a detailed understanding and knowledge about battery chemistry, rather only needs sensors to monitor battery voltage and current. The developed approach is validated at room temperature using two types of lithium-ion batteries under a pulse discharge test. In addition, the proposed model is verified under varying temperature settings under EV drive cycles. The experimental results demonstrate that the DSA optimized RFR algorithm achieves RMSE of 0.382% in the HPPC test using LiNMC battery. Besides, the proposed method obtains satisfactory outcomes in EV drive cycles, estimating MAE of 0.193% and 0.346% in DST and FUDS cycles, respectively, at 25°C.",

    "abstract": "In the growth of intelligent surveillance and computer vision, pedestrian intrusion detection (PID) has been widely applied in security, automatic driving and many other fields. Vision-based PID aims at detecting whether pedestrians invade an area-of-interest (AoI). For dynamic PID task, we need to identify the invading individuals from a large amount of pedestrian objects in a varying AoI scene, which is very challenging. We take the first attempt to solve this issue and propose a network named PIDNet to address it. In the PIDNet, we design an efficient dual-branch network, which combines region segmentation and pedestrian object detection. The final intrusion judgement is made by analyzing the position relation between a segmented AoI and a detected pedestrian. With the lightweight network design, PIDNet can detect pedestrian objects and segment AoI simultaneously, and make intrusion judgment efficiently. In order to achieve better intrusion detection performance, we further propose a netowrk with a cross-association strategy (cross-PIDNet) to improve the feature extraction capability of dual-branch network. In this strategy, we build the connection between detection branch and segmentation branch, avoiding the redundancy of non-critical intrusion features and enhancing the expression of critical intrusion features. Meanwhile, we design a multi-scale intrusion judgment module, which makes the judgment of intrusion state more robust. Since neither public datasets nor a benchmark is available in this direction, we set up a benchmark dataset and corresponding evaluation metrics. Experimental results indicate that our cross-PIDNet can reach 74.7% \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$PID\\_{A}cc$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n and 50.8% \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$PID\\_{A}P$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n.",

    "abstract": "Optimization problems for trajectory planning in autonomous vehicle racing are characterized by their nonlinearity and nonconvexity. Instead of solving these optimization problems, usually a convex approximation is solved instead to achieve a high update rate. We present a real-time-capable model predictive control (MPC) trajectory planner based on a nonlinear single-track vehicle model and Pacejka’s magic tire formula for autonomous vehicle racing. After formulating the general nonconvex trajectory optimization problem, we form a convex approximation using sequential convex programming (SCP). The state of the art convexifies track constraints using sequential linearization (SL), which is a method of relaxing the constraints. Solutions to the relaxed optimization problem are not guaranteed to be feasible in the nonconvex optimization problem. We propose sequential convex restriction (SCR) as a method to convexify track constraints. SCR guarantees that resulting solutions are feasible in the nonconvex optimization problem. We show recursive feasibility of solutions to the restricted optimization problem. The MPC is evaluated on a scaled version of the Hockenheimring racing track in simulation. The results show that MPC using SCR yields faster lap times than MPC using SL, while still being real-time capable.",

    "abstract": "End-to-end autonomous driving provides a simple and efficient framework for autonomous driving systems, which can directly obtain control commands from raw perception data. However, it fails to address stability and interpretability problems in complex urban scenarios. In this paper, we construct a two-stage end-to-end autonomous driving model for complex urban scenarios, named HIIL (Hierarchical Interpretable Imitation Learning), which integrates interpretable BEV mask and steering angle to solve the problems shown above. In Stage One, we propose a pretrained Bird's Eye View (BEV) model which leverages a BEV mask to present an interpretation of the surrounding environment. In Stage Two, we construct an Interpretable Imitation Learning (IIL) model that fuses BEV latent feature from Stage One with an additional steering angle from Pure-Pursuit (PP) algorithm. In the HIIL model, visual information is converted to semantic images by the semantic segmentation network, and the semantic images are encoded to extract the BEV latent feature, which are decoded to predict BEV masks and fed to the IIL as perception data. In this way, the BEV latent feature bridges the BEV and IIL models. Visual information can be supplemented by the calculated steering angle for PP algorithm, speed vector, and location information, thus it could have better performance in complex and terrible scenarios. Our HIIL model meets an urgent requirement for interpretability and robustness of autonomous driving. We validate the proposed model in the CARLA simulator with extensive experiments which show remarkable interpretability, generalization, and robustness capability in unknown scenarios for navigation tasks.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a distributed trajectory optimization and control problem for a collection of vehicles with a quadratic spacing policy. A quadratic spacing policy is introduced based on the expected platoon speed to improve flexibility of speed planning and regulation. The trajectory optimization problem is solved using distributed convex optimization based on spacing errors minimization, resulting in an algorithm to provide the optimal trajectory for all following vehicles. Then, a PID-type sliding mode controller with a double high-power reaching law is presented for speed tracking control of each follower. The methodology can guarantee the internal stability, string stability and traffic flow stability with ignorable turbulence of spacing and speed, as demonstrated by numerical simulations.",

    "doi": "10.1109/TIV.2022.3184976",
    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Due to the difference of data modalities, it’s a very challenging task to find the feature correspondences between 2D and 3D data in LiDAR-Camera calibration. In existing works, the establishment of the cross-model correspondence is always simplified by specifically designing artificial targets or restricting the region of searching correspondences with the help of initial extrinsic parameters. To achieve automatic LiDAR-Camera calibration without prior knowledge, we propose a novel self-adaptive LiDAR-Camera calibration approach named \n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ATOP</b>\n which realizes a cascaded procedure of ATtention-to-OPtimization. In the attention stage, an attention-based object-level matching network called Cross-Modal Matching Network (CMON) is designed for finding the overlapped FOV(Field of View) between camera and LiDAR, and producing 2D-3D object-level correspondences. In the optimization stage, two cascaded PSO-based (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithms, namely \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Point</i>\n-PSO and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Pose</i>\n-PSO, are designed to estimate the LiDAR-Camera extrinsic parameters. Different from previous works, the proposed calibration method does not require any artificial targets or initial pose guesses, therefore it can be applied to achieve online self-adaptive LiDAR-Camera calibration. Besides, this is the first work, to our best knowledge, to achieve object-level matching between uncalibrated camera and LiDAR data. Experimental results on both the collected datasets and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Optimization-based trajectory planners for an autonomous vehicle have received increasing attention due to their convenience for handling various complex constraints. However, their formulated trajectory planning optimization problems in unstructured environments are highly non-convex and nonlinear, requiring a proper initial guess to help with convergence. Given the low efficiency of common sampling-and-search-based initialization strategies due to the dimensionality brought by complex vehicle dynamics and the maneuverable space narrowed by cluttered obstacles, the sequential optimization of a series of softened intermediate problems is emerging as a new initialization strategy. Unlike sequential optimization-based strategies, which optimize all decision variables (w.r.t. the positions, velocities, vehicle orientations, steering angles, and so on of all waypoints) for initialization, the proposed strategy only optimizes critical variables, whose values should help satisfy the inequalities strictly with a small equation violation. Thus, the original scheme for initialization is decoupled into two sub-tasks with down-sized variables. One reduces the nonlinear equation violation, and the other ensures strict inequality satisfaction. Experimental results show that the proposed initialization strategy can facilitate the solution of an optimization-based trajectory planner, thereby making the trajectory planner outperform the state-of-the-art competitors in this community.",

    "abstract": "Driverless train control systems are becoming popular in the world. Notably, this technology has already been applied for several years. However, these kinds of Automatic Train Operation systems are still under the framework that network elements and movement authority are generated from the ground control center. Hence, the aforementioned rail systems are “automated” but not “autonomous,” and the architecture utilization and train tracking interval are limited. With the development of advanced sensors and control algorithms, the train intends to be equipped with a decision-making capability. In order to further improve train movement coordination and efficiency, an Autonomous Train Control System (ATCS) is proposed. This paper provides three main contributions: Firstly, the system structure is described, and the information following in ATCS is discussed with general operation scenarios. Secondly, data isolation is broken under ATCS, and data prediction and edge-based information fusion are applied to process the real dynamic data and estimate the train's speed and position. Thirdly, with the assistant of data fusion, model predictive and data-based control methodologies are discussed.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "A framework that could achieve submeter-level-accurate horizontal navigation with carrier phase differential measurements from cellular signals is developed. This framework, termed CD-cellular, is composed of a base and a rover in a cellular environment, both making carrier phase measurements to the same cellular base transceiver stations (BTSs). The base shares its carrier phase measurements with the mobile rover, which in turn employs an extended Kalman filter to obtain a coarse estimate of its states, followed by a batch weighted nonlinear least squares (B-WNLS) estimator to solve for the integer ambiguities, and finally a point-solution WNLS to estimate its own states. The framework is designed to guarantee that after some time, the rover's position error remains below a pre-defined threshold with a desired probability. This is achieved by leveraging models of the BTS positions from stochastic geometry. Experimental results on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an open semi-urban environment with multipath-free, line-of-sight (LOS) conditions are presented, showing that the developed framework achieves a 70.48 cm position root mean-squared error (RMSE) over a trajectory of 2.24 km, measured with respect to the UAV's navigation solution from its onboard GPS-inertial navigation system (INS).",

    "abstract": "The emerging connected automated vehicle (CAV) technique brings a new opportunity for the development of cooperative collision avoidance systems. This paper proposes a distributed coordinated brake control (DCBC) algorithm for longitudinal collision avoidance of multiple CAVs. Firstly, the studied scenario is defined, within which the communication topology and vehicle dynamics are modeled for a vehicle string and the control objective is designed to minimize the total relative kinetic energy. Next, the control problem is formulated into a centralized model predictive control problem, which is then transformed into a quadratic programming (QP) problem. By separating the QP problem into several sub-problems assigned to each CAV, distributed optimization is introduced to solve the QP problem in a distributed manner. Elaborate numerical simulation comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed DCBC algorithm.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "The tradeoff between speed and accuracy is important in semantic segmentation problems, especially for resource-constrained platforms, such as intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a well-deployed real-time semantic segmentation architecture named MLFNet. Specifically, we first build a lightweight backbone (SEFE) with a larger receptive field and multi-scale contextual representation performance to encode the pixel-level features. For better preserving target boundaries and contours, a spatial compensation branch (SPFE) is designed to gradually reduce the dimension of feature maps and refine the low-level specifics. In the decoding phase, we introduce a well-designed multi-branch fusion extractor (MBFD) for integrating the spatial details into high-level layers. Finally, the outputs from the semantic and spatial branches are fused to predict the final segmentation results. Extensive offline and online experiments have shown that our model has a superior speed and accuracy trade-off. On the Cityscapes test dataset, our model (MLFNet-Res18) achieves 71.0% mIoU with 95.1 FPS for 512 × 1024 inputs, and 72.1% mIoU with 72.2 FPS while inferring on MLFNet-Res34 model. Meanwhile, MLFNet-Res18 can reach 24.5 FPS when deployed to NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and 64.0 FPS with an experimental vehicle.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is one of the greatest environmental hazards to mankind. The emission of greenhouse gases has resulted in a continuous increase in the temperature of the atmosphere leading to Global warming. CO2 continues to be the leading contributor to the greenhouse effect, with transport being a major CO2 emission source. The majority of transport emissions are from road transport i.e. vehicular emissions. To control vehicular emission, first, an efficient emission monitoring system is required. Direct sensor installation in individual vehicles is neither cost-effective nor the data is easy to collect. In this paper, a scalable vehicle CO2 emission prediction model is proposed which uses vehicle On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) port data. The proposed system uses real-time in-vehicle sensor data to estimate CO2 emission of the vehicle using a Recurrent neural network (RNN) based Long short-term memory(LSTM) model. OBD-II dongles can be used to easily transmit the vehicle’s sensor data to the cloud, where the LSTM model uses this data to estimate the real-time CO2 emission of the vehicle. The proposed model provides a scalable and efficient system to monitor emissions at a vehicular level and, has been evaluated using public OBD-II dataset.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the convex optimization frameworks for accurate and fast negative obstacle detection as well as depth estimations that are vital for real-time, superior autonomous vehicle operations. A convex framework is proposed in conjunction with a unique stereo perception approach to manage the complex nature of such invisible obstacles. The proposed stereo configuration incorporates an alignment that displaces the cameras along a vertical baseline to extract useful information pertaining to negative obstacle features for various illustrative terrain settings. The convex framework exploits these properties to evaluate depth jumps in the disparity space image and perform geometrical analysis of potential occlusion regions. The corresponding convex formulations are based on linear matrix inequalities to detect sudden disparity, angle profile, and intensity variations for potential negative obstacles and to estimate the internal depth of the detected obstacles. Experimental results demonstrate that consecutive processes can be structured in a convex framework to efficiently identify negative obstacle attributes at a range of distances for texture varying environments, providing a vital extension to real-time vehicular system implementations with superior detection rates.",

    "abstract": "The accurate position is a key requirement for autonomous vehicles. Although Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are widely used in many applications, their performance is often disturbed, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, many studies consider multi-sensor integration and cooperative positioning (CP) approaches to provide additional degrees of freedom to address the shortcomings of GNSS. However, few studies adopted real-world datasets and internode ranging outliers within CP is left untouched, leading to unexpected challenges in practical applications. To address this, we propose a Robust Cooperative Positioning (RCP) scheme that augments the GPS with the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) system. A field experiment is conducted to generate a real-world dataset to evaluate the RCP scheme. Moreover, the analysis of the collected dataset enables us to optimise a simple but effective Robust Kalman Filter (RKF) to mitigate the influence of outlier measurements and improve the robustness of the proposed solution. Finally, a simulated dataset is derived from the real-world data to comprehensively study the performance of the proposed RCP method in urban canyon scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed solution can crucially improve positioning performance when the number of visible GPS satellite is limited and is robust against various adverse effects in such environments.",

    "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based indoor positioning generally utilizes repeaters to amplify and retransmit the original GNSS signals to indoor receivers. To improve the positioning accuracy with GNSS repeaters in indoor environments such as an underground parking lot and an enclosed depot, in this paper, a carrier phase measurement based differential indoor positioning method is proposed. Without reference stations, the carrier phases measured by using the repeated signals are differenced between repeaters. Considering that upon carrier tracking loop locking the signals the carrier phase cycle integer ambiguity remains unchanged, the differenced phase measurements at two consecutive epochs are combined to find the receiver position. Receiver coordinates and phase cycle integer ambiguities are solved jointly with assistant Least-squares AMBiguity Decorrelation Adjustment (LAMBDA) algorithm. High positioning accuracy is achieved by the proposed technique, and this is verified by close-to-reality simulations.",

    "abstract": "Tracking algorithms with low computational complexity and reliable performance are important in developing advanced driver assistance systems (DAS). This paper proposes a method of single-pedestrian tracking using thermal infrared cameras to meet the needs of DAS operating in nighttime and low-visibility conditions. The proposed algorithm uses the background-aware correlation filter (BACF) as the basic tracking framework. In order to address the problem that directly introducing the convolutional features leads to tracking performance degradation in the BACF framework, this paper proposes a fusion scheme to integrate handcrafted and convolutional features to make full use of the advantages of both the features. The proposed scheme combines response maps from convolutional and handcrafted features through fusion coefficients to improve the performance of the trackers based on the single features. In order to calculate fusion coefficients, a novel approach of searching the main peak and interference peaks of a response map is proposed by using local binary pattern values of the response map to locate all local maximum points. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing 9 competing tracking algorithms and can be used in vehicle platforms as a module of DAS to improve the safe level of driving in nighttime.",

We offer a target simulator testing LiDAR systems under automotive conditions. Therefore, data are projected over-the-air by laser signals on the LiDAR detector. This work presents a concept of a LiDAR target simulator with regards to LiDAR systems using the direct time-of-flight principle. We develope design considerations for a screen discussing undesired screen reflections, a curved screen form and the positioning of light sources on this screen. As one main solution, we introduce a concept of an antireflective screen. For the scenario simulation, we derive a model delivering the required optical power representing a simulated target, which is combined with the simulated time-of-flight. Considering no prior knowledge of the LiDAR system under test, we discuss the required calibration data and timing resolution. Thereby, we suggest an optimized time-of-flight concept requiring only one optical trigger to determine the LiDAR measurement start. All requirements are supported by calculated example parameters based on real LiDAR systems. Altogether, we discuss main challenges and possible solutions of our LiDAR target simulator, which will allow a safer and more efficient development of LiDAR systems.",

Groups of pedestrians with the social norm move along similar trajectories, while groups of pedestrians with different norms make changes to their trajectories to avoid a collision. This paper introduces a group-based forecasting module for modeling inter- and intra-group interactions to enable an understanding of the social norm of humans for trajectory forecasting. In addition, group-based forecasting module takes the trajectory predicted by another prospection module as input to consider potential interactions with other groups in the future. In this way, our method models the complex group-level social interactions in crowded scenes through the attention mechanism and predicts socially plausible trajectories in accordance with each social norm. Comparisons we conducted with state-of-the-art forecasting methods show the effectiveness of our approach on three publicly available crowd datasets (ETH, UCY, and SDD). From experimental results, our network enables to predict plausible social trajectories by introducing two forecasting modules.",

    "abstract": "Traffic situations with interacting participants pose difficulties for today’s autonomous vehicles to interpret situations and eventually achieve their own mission goal. Interactive planning approaches are promising solutions for solving such situations. However, most approaches are only assessed in simulation, as researchers lack the resources to operate an autonomous vehicle. Likewise, open-source stacks for autonomous driving, such as Apollo, provide competitive and resource-efficient state-of-the-art planning algorithms. However, promising planning concepts from research are usually not included within a reasonable time, possibly due to resource restrictions or technical limitations. Without evaluating these novel algorithms in reality, the benefits and shortcomings of proposed approaches cannot be thoroughly assessed. This work aims to contribute methodology and implementation to integrate a novel mixed-integer optimization-based planning algorithm in Apollo’s planning component and assess its performance and real-time capability in theory and practice. It discusses the necessary modifications of Apollo for deployment on a different vehicle and presents three real-world driving experiments on a public road alongside a detailed experience report. The driving experiments show a smooth trajectory tracking performance operating robustly under varying perception data quality and the real-time capability of the closed-loop system.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Approaches to keeping a dynamical system within state constraints typically rely on a model-based safety condition to limit the control signals. In the face of significant modeling uncertainty, the system can suffer from important performance penalties due to the safety condition becoming overly conservative. Machine learning can be employed to reduce the uncertainty around the system dynamics, and allow for higher performance. In this article, we propose the safe uncertainty-learning principle, and argue that the learning must be properly structured to preserve safety guarantees. For instance, robust safety conditions are necessary, and they must be initialized with conservative uncertainty bounds prior to learning. Also, the uncertainty bounds should only be tightened if the collected data sufficiently captures the future system behavior. To support the principle, two example problems are solved with control barrier functions: a lane-change controller for an autonomous vehicle, and an adaptive cruise controller. This work offers a way to evaluate whether machine learning preserves safety guarantees during the control of uncertain dynamical systems. It also highlights challenging aspects of learning for control.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a localization method based on the global magnetic positioning system (GMPS) using a magneto-impedance sensor, which was developed for automated driving systems to obtain precise vehicle positions under all conditions, including snow or rain. The aim of this study is to verify the stability, robustness, and high accuracy of the proposed method, and propose appropriate intervals for magnetic markers. This localization method accurately calculates the sideslip angle because a noisy acceleration sensor is not required except for the identification process. The estimated positions and orientation are filtered through an extended Kalman filter as the vehicle passes the magnetic markers. The robust stability of the proposed method is verified using the small-gain theorem, which shows that the intervals for magnetic markers should be less than 38.6 m for a city bus. Experimental results using a city bus and GMPS show that there is a possibility that the intervals of magnetic markers are extended to 30 m at small curvature, and 10 m at large curvature from the current 2 m intervals. These results indicate that the maximum intervals to avoid lane deviation of vehicles depend on the reference path curvature.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in lane detection based on deep neural networks have enhanced the detection performance of intelligent vehicles under different traffic scenes. However, it’s still difficult for existing lane detection algorithms to robustly extract lane instances and adapt to varying lane numbers simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on anchor-free methods and propose an adaptive multi-lane detection approach based on instance segmentation for intelligent vehicles. By combining instance segmentation with lane center estimation, the proposed approach achieves robust and efficient performance. Besides, cosine-metric is incorporated into the objective functions that enables the proposed method to extract more discriminative features for foreground extraction. Different from the proposed approach, most existing algorithms treat the lane instance detection task as a multi-class object detection problem which require to predefine different lane categories and fix the lane number in advance, while the lane category predefinition degrades the robustness of the algorithms. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better overall performance compared with the state-of-the-art anchor-free lane detection methods. It is also illustrated that the proposed approach can be easily extended to other instance segmentation tasks, e.g. vehicle segmentation.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of advanced driver assistance systems, driver-automation cooperative control becomes more challenging due to the uncertainty of driver behaviors. To this end, this paper proposes a shared control approach to assist drivers in path-tracking and collision avoidance. A high-fidelity CarSim vehicle model embedded driver simulator is built to collect the driver data, based on which the normalized steering angle input and the time to collision are defined to quantify the driving performance. Then, these performance indices are employed to develop the fuzzy controller and determine the control authority for the steering assistance system (SAS). A multi-constraints model predictive control is designed to follow the desired path, and simultaneously ensure the vehicle stability. Different from the traditional constraints handling method, the state constraint is transformed into the input constraint considering the nonlinearity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with two less experienced drivers. The test results show that the path-tracking performance and vehicle stability can be guaranteed with less control effort.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based stereomatching methods have produced remarkable results in recent years. However, typical supervised learning-based methods always suffer from the non-negligible problem of costly and time-consuming depth annotations. To mitigate this issue, in this work, a multi-stage unsupervised stereo matching method based on the cascaded Siamese network is proposed. To obtain a better performance on depth annotations, the improvements of this work are as follows. Firstly, sparse costs are constructed to predict the coarse disparity, and an adaptive sampling strategy is developed to dynamically adjust the sampling interval and effectively narrow the disparity search range. The proposed cost sparse and sampling strategy can certainly guarantee the accuracy of disparity estimation under the limited memory requirements. Then, geometric constraints with left and right semantic features are integrated into the loss function to learn the inherent matching correspondences. Next, information entropy of the probability volume is used to measure the quality of estimated disparity and designed as weighted guidance for the photometric loss. Finally, a pixel-wise disparity refinement module is designed to achieve high-resolution disparity estimation at the final stage. Experimental results on the datasets, including SceneFlow and KITTI, show the effectiveness and practicability of our method with limited memory consumption and running time.",

    "abstract": "Automated driving systems need to perform according to what human drivers expect in every situation. A different behavior can be wrongly interpreted by other human drivers and cause traffic problems, disturbances to other road participants, or in the worst case, an accident. In this paper, we propose a behavior cloning concept for learning high-level decisions from recorded trajectories of real traffic. We summarized and gave a clear definition of the main features that affect how humans make driving decisions. Some other approaches rely on complex neural networks where their decisions are impossible to understand. Due to the importance of the decision making module, we produce safe human-like behavior which is transparent to humans and easy to track. Furthermore, the learned policy is not overfitting to the limited training data and generalizes well to multi-lane scenarios with arbitrary speed limits and traffic density, which is strengthened by the successful application of merging policy on exiting. Simulation evaluations show that our learned policy is able to handle the intention uncertainty of surrounding agents, and provide human-like decisions in the sense of well-balanced behavior between efficiency, comfort, perceived safety, and politeness.",

    "publication_date": "Jan. 2023",
    "abstract": "Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel generalized multiple access technology which can control the interference in multi-user communication systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has also been proven to improve the spectral efficiency in the next-generation (beyond 5 G (B5G) and 6 G) wireless communication networks. Thus, in this paper, we explore the RSMA scheme for RIS-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multi-user vehicular communication network in the presence of co-channel interference. The communication between the UAV and the desired vehicle takes place through an RIS along with the direct link and is interfered by multiple interfering vehicles operating in the same spectrum. After deriving the approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) of common and private stream signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at the desired vehicle in the interference limited scenario, we obtain an expression for the average outage probability (AOP) over the complete flying duration of the UAV. Furthermore, the optimum RSMA power allocation coefficients in each time slot of UAV flight duration are obtained by minimizing the Sum-AOP over all the desired vehicles. The performance of the proposed RSMA based RIS-aided vehicular communication network is compared with (a) RSMA based network without RIS and (b) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based RIS-aided counterpart. The numerical results reveal the superiority of RSMA over NOMA and the significance of deploying RIS in considered vehicular communication network. The analytical results are corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations.",

Initially, we provide an overview of vehicular sensors and Off-the-Shelf (OTS) devices. Then, we focus on exteroceptive sensors, identifying different technologies, usages, pros and cons, as well as their availability in existing OTS devices. Next, we review the services and applications using exteroceptive sensors, especially regarding safety, navigation, and driving profiling.

    "abstract": "The challenges in providing convincing arguments for safe and correct behavior of automated driving (AD) systems have so far hindered their widespread commercial deployment. Conventional development approaches such as testing and simulation are limited by non-exhaustive analysis, and can thus not guarantee safety in all possible scenarios. Formal methods can provide mathematical proofs that could be used to produce rigorous evidence to support the safety argument. This paper investigates the use of differential dynamic logic and the deductive verification tool KeYmaera X in the development of an AD feature. Specifically, this paper demonstrates how formal models and safety proofs of different design variants of a Decision & Control module can be used in the safety argument of an in-lane AD feature. In doing so, the assumptions and invariant conditions necessary to guarantee safety are identified, and the paper shows how such an analysis helps during the development process in requirement refinement and formulation of the operational design domain. Furthermore, it is shown how the performance of the different models is formally analyzed exhaustively, in \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">all</i>\n their allowed behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Formal models for the safety validation of autonomous vehicles have become increasingly important. To this end, we present a safety framework for longitudinal automated driving. This framework allows calculating minimum safe inter-vehicular distances for arbitrary ego vehicle control policies. We use this framework to enhance the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model and models based on it, which fail to cover situations where the ego vehicle has a higher decelerating capacity than its preceding vehicle. For arbitrary ego vehicle control policies, we show how our framework can be applied by substituting real (possibly computationally intractable) controllers with upper bounding functions. This comprises a general approach for longitudinal safety, where safety guarantees for the upper-bounded system are equivalent to those for the original system but come at the expense of larger inter-vehicular distances.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in attack/anomaly detection and resilience strategies for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are reviewed from vehicle dynamics and control perspective. Compared to traditional vehicles, CAVs are featured in the increasing number of perception sensors, advanced intra-vehicle communication technologies, capabilities of driving automation and connectivity between single vehicles. These features bring about safety issues which are not encountered in traditional vehicle systems. One main type of these issues is the attack or anomaly launched onto the perception sensors and the communication channels. With such a consideration, this survey summarizes and reviews the existing results on attack/anomaly detection and resilience of CAVs in control frameworks. This paper reviews the results according to the positions at which the attacks/anomalies occur. These positions are divided into three categories, namely, intra-vehicle communication network, perception sensors and inter-vehicle communication network. From this perspective, the recent attack/anomaly detection and resilience results are reviewed according to different positions attacked. After reviewing existing results, some potential research directions and challenges are identified.",

    "abstract": "An approach to resilient planning and control of autonomous vehicles in multi-vehicle traffic scenarios is proposed. The proposed method is based on model predictive control (MPC), where alternative predictions of the surrounding traffic are determined automatically such that they are intentionally adversarial to the ego vehicle. This provides robustness against the inherent uncertainty in traffic predictions. To reduce conservatism, an assumption that other agents are of no ill intent is formalized. Simulation results from highway driving scenarios show that the proposed method in real-time negotiates traffic situations out of scope for a nominal MPC approach and performs favorably to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches without requiring prior training. The results also show that the proposed method performs effectively, with the ability to prune disturbance sequences with a lower risk for the ego vehicle.",

    "abstract": "Motion prediction is the fundamental input for decision-making in autonomous vehicles. The current motion prediction solutions are designed with a strong reliance on black box predictions based on neural networks (NNs), which is unacceptable for safety-critical applications. Motion prediction with high uncertainty can cause conflicting decisions and even catastrophic results. To address this issue, an uncertainty estimation approach based on the deep ensemble technique is proposed for motion prediction in this paper. Subsequently, the estimated uncertainty is considered in the decision-making module to improve driving safety. Firstly, a motion prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is built and the deep ensemble technique is utilized to obtain both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty of the prediction model. Besides, an uncertainty-aware potential field is developed to process the prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, a decision-making framework is proposed based on the model predictive control algorithm that considers the uncertainty-aware potential field, road boundaries, and multiple constraints of vehicle dynamics.

    "abstract": "Drivers are being confronted by the task of controlling vehicles together with automation systems before autonomous vehicles are even fully realized. A novel human-oriented online driving authority optimization shared steering framework is proposed to solve the problem of allocating driving authority between automation and human driver, in which the model predictive control(MPC) method is used to online optimize the driving authority. The merits of this framework is that, on the one hand, human driver workload can be alleviated in the case that the driver and the automation have similar driving intentions. On the other hand, the human driver has absolute control authority over an intelligent vehicle when the automation intention is inconsistent with that of the human driver. To illustrate the characteristics of the designed online driving authority optimization framework, simulations are carried out in the case of driver-automation cooperation and driver-automation non-cooperation. The results show that the proposed online driving authority optimization shared steering framework can not only restrict vehicles to safe areas but also lessen the driver’s workload.",

    "abstract": "To fully realize the potential of autonomous aerial vehicles, a reliable, robust, and accurate navigation system is required. Current technologies composing such a system include stand-alone and augmented global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), as well as visual, inertial, and signals-of-opportunity (SOPs) approaches. However, as it is well understood that no single alternative can meet the requirements for full autonomy, a combination of technologies is required to address alternative application scenarios. In this work, an online technique for relative positioning of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed that capitalizes on SOPs in conjunction with inertial measurements for localization and navigation when GNSS signals are not readily available. The proposed system uses the signals’ characteristics over a large part of the frequency spectrum, in conjunction with an optimal learning (OL) technique, to adaptively choose a sequence of frequencies that provide location estimates in real-time. Subsequently, inertial measurements, which are provided by an onboard unit, are employed to improve on the tracking accuracy. Field experiments, using an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution under various parameter settings.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of autonomous driving technologies, a vast array of autonomous driving algorithms and platforms have emerged. These algorithms and platforms are usually designed for different tasks in specific scenarios, which makes them incompatible with each other. To solve the problem, we propose a ubiquitous operating system named Parallel Driving Operating System (PDOS) based on the parallel driving theory. Specifically, the PDOS architecture includes the hardware layer, the kernel layer, the functional layer, and the application layer, which can realize heterogeneous hardware support, ubiquitous resource management, algorithm optimization, and ubiquitous application development, respectively. Moreover, we derive the PDOS into specific operating systems in four application scenarios, i.e., intelligent mining, intelligent warehousing, intelligent logistics, and intelligent port. To validate the PDOS, we test its usability, reliability, and efficiency in these scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate the high performance of PDOS in multiple autonomous driving, and indicate that PDOS is an efficient operating system for parallel driving.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel method for vehicle-pedestrian path prediction that takes into account the awareness of the driver and the pedestrian towards each other. The method jointly models the paths of vehicle and pedestrian within a single Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). In this DBN, sub-graphs model the environment and entity-specific context cues of the vehicle and pedestrian (incl. awareness), which affect their future motion and allow to increase the prediction horizon. These sub-graphs share a latent state which models whether vehicle and pedestrian are on collision course; this accounts for a certain degree of motion coupling. The method was validated with real-world data obtained by on-board vehicle sensing (stereo vision, GNSS and proprioceptive). Data consist of 93 vehicle and pedestrian encounters, spanning various awareness conditions and dynamic characteristics of the participants. In ablation studies, we quantify the benefits of various components of our proposed DBN model for path prediction and collision risk estimation. Results show that at a prediction horizon of 1.5 s, context-aware models outperform context-agnostic models in path prediction for scenarios with a dynamics change, while performing similarly otherwise. Results further indicate that driver attention-aware models improve collision risk estimation compared to driver-agnostic models.",

    "publication_date": "Dec. 2022",
    "abstract": "It is of great significance for safe driving to study drivers' eye movement and driving operation behavior when they encounter other road users violating traffic rules. The underlying reason is that most drivers are unable to process the unexpected visual stimulation, which is more likely to lead to driving accidents, especially in a hybrid situation. In this study, a driving simulator is used to design driving scenarios and study the driving performance of drivers with different driving experiences when other road users violate traffic rules. The experimental results show that some novice drivers ignore the position of their own vehicle when they encounter traffic violations which will lead to the collision with other road users. Moreover, some novice drivers can only perform one of the operations between steering and braking to avoid collision in these emergent situations. They cannot reasonably combine braking and steering to complete emergency driving operations like experienced drivers. Finally, when the driving difficulty increases, experienced drivers spend less time looking and more time scanning their surroundings to ensure that they can cope with the more complex driving environment while novice drivers do the opposite. This study reveals the difference between novices and experienced drivers, which paves a useful reference for the future advanced driving assistance system.",
